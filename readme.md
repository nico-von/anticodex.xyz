# Welcome to the Anticodex Content Base

## What is the Anticodex?
The Anticodex is a stage upon which the public may behold and trace a portion of the evolution of my knowledge and unfolding of my thoughts. It stands as a record of my mind's labour, a reflection of its illuminations, a map of part of my understanding, and a testament to my endeavours in *seeking the most complete form of TRUTH*.

It is not the system itself, but a representation of its application.

## Tracking Content Development
Every change to a content file will have a commit of its own. This way, it will be easier to track the history and development of the file. It also frees me from the extra labour of adding content development notes into shards(except when necessary), as I can simply trace the development in the repository instead.

A commit message is now automatically generated to indicate whether revisions made to a content file are minor or major, and to highlight changes in titles and categories, rather than relying on plain, file-name-only automated commit messages.

## Introducing Changes
Since I welcome contributions from any source, you, the observer, may introduce changes that will benefit the system, and therefore, my mind.

However, I cannot permit pull requests to alter the contents of the **Anticodex** directly. As the system is a *thought machine*, my mind must go through the ritual of placing thoughts into it by my own hand. Only thus can each idea impress itself more firmly upon my mind, and thus be faithfully reflected within the Anticodex.

#### Ways of Introducing Change
- Creating a **GitHub Issue**
- Sending me an **Email**

You may send me corrections or any other changes; You need only include the **title of the shard** you wish to influence, and clearly indicate the nature of your proposed modification (Correction, Addition, etc.).

#### Attributed to You
All changes you introduce shall be **attributed to you** in the shard you have influenced, as well as in the **sources directory** of the Anticodex.

## Format
Everything is in Obsidian format as Obsidian is where the use of my system takes place.

## Completeness
As this is a **public representation** of my system. Some portions cannot be shared for various reasons, primarily those of legal and privacy restrictions. The **complete** representation of my system (the complete Anticodex) remains **private**, accessible to me alone.
