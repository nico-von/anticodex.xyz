The contents of the Anticodex are raw (lore entries excepted). As I mentioned in *[[Who the Anticodex is for]]*, its contents are composed solely for my comprehension, and thus a polished, properly edited version for an audience is neither intended nor necessary. I also prioritise efficiency and speed in using the system, and therefore must forgo writing with the audience in mind. As an added benefit, this practice serves to restrain my constant urge for perfection.
