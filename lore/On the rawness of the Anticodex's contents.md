The contents of the Anticodex are raw (lore entries excepted). As I mentioned in *[[The Anticodex is made public for your eyes, but is written for myself]]*, its contents are composed solely for my comprehension, and thus a polished, properly edited version for an audience is neither intended nor necessary. I also prioritise efficiency and speed in using the system, and therefore must forgo writing with the audience in mind. As an added benefit, this practice serves to restrain my perfectionism.
