*Shards* are pieces of information extracted from a source and made to convey a thought independently, without reliance on the original context. They evolve over time under the influence of new shards. They are similar to main notes in a Zettelkasten.

Furthermore, as the Anticodex is [[What the Anticodex is|a trace of a portion of the evolution of my knowledge and unfolding of my thoughts]], shards can therefore be seen as **footprints**; they cannot reveal the true form of the discoveries taking place in my mind. They cannot show the full extent of my knowledge. What you see in the Anticodex are merely **remnants** of my engagement with my system.

Shards are thus *windows* into the past of my thinking, they are *shards of my thoughts*.
