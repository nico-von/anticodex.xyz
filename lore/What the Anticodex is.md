The Anticodex is a stage upon which the public may behold and trace a portion of the evolution of my knowledge and unfolding of my thoughts. It stands as a record of my mind's labour, a reflection of its illuminations, a map of part of my understanding, and a testament to my endeavours in seeking the *most complete form of TRUTH*.

It is not [[The system behind the Anticodex|the system]] itself, but a representation of its application.
