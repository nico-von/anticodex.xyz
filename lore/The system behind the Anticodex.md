Its main purpose is to seek *[[On the creation of new coherent wholes#^-nco8|the most complete form of TRUTH]]* within the limits of my capacity, and to achieve the fullest, clearest understanding possible of any subject that seizes my curiosity, crosses my path, or benefits the thoughts already contained within the [[What the Anticodex is|Anticodex]].
