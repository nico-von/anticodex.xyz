My rule is that if it contains an idea that is 'atomic' in its own right, meaning I can reuse it elsewhere, I'll make a new file. I call these scaffoldings or scaffolds. Scaffolds are still 'main notes', and they often contain obvious or old knowledge as their main purpose is to prevent repeating myself (DRY programming principle but to the ZK)

Such scaffoldings can be sourced or unsourced. However, I do not want to tag them as such as new knowledge will become scaffolds in the future anyway as they become old and obvious knowledge, and that way they will no longer reflect the truth about their status as scaffolds and will be a pain to update. Also, obvious and prior knowledge that I deem as scaffolds today were once new insights anyway!
