I made the Anticodex for several reasons.

First, as with most people, I want to work in public. Working in public makes me more likely to progress through my reading list (as it has already piled up considerably) and remain consistent in my efforts. It also places me under *constant judgement*, helping me to conquer that common fear of being judged. Furthermore, the public will be able to correct the inevitable untruths that I shall, from time to time, write. And of course, it allows me to share my progress with the world.

Second, to ensure that the knowledge I acquire is put to use, and to serve as proof of my claims should I ever need it.

Thirdly, simply for the joy of it.
