Unlike a codex, this repository is not bound together in a specific, sequential order of content. It is, rather, a product of disorderâ€”an *Anti* codex. Its writing is scattered across time and order, subject, and context, yet remain bound by links, visible through [[The Paths|paths]]. A given [[The Shards|shard]] may follow another written long before, or leap to an entirely different subject or context. 

I have thought of several possible names for this repository, but I found **Anticodex** to represent it the best.
