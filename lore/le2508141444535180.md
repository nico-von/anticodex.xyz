Sources are coherent wholes from which shards are taken. They are similar to *literature notes* in the conventional Zettelkasten method. Collections of selected quotations reside within them as well; however, only works in the **public domain** are displayed publicly.

Sources can be anything from a Reddit comment to a dissertation.
