Despite being published openly to your eyes, the Anticodex was conceived and written foremost for myself. Hence, some parts may seem arcane or esoteric. I shaped it according to my own tastes, with neither audience nor observer in mind. After all, it is for my mind to understand, and my mind holds the keys to unlock its full meaning and contexts. 

So, pardon me if certain things cannot be readily grasped. I do, however, take care to ensure that I shall understand them in the far future. For this reason, I strive to write each piece in such a way that I may clearly comprehend it when the time comes to revisit it, an approach which, in turn, should aid your own reading. Moreover, the amount of reading and writing undertaken through the system behind the Anticodex ought, at the very least, to refine my writing, and thus benefit your understanding.
