This development is **perpetual**. Nothing in the Anticodex can ever be deemed final, for every thought is a work in progress. Thus, you, the *observer*, may encounter thoughts that seem erroneous, or completely false. Should that occur, I ask only this: allow time, and the paths, to do their work, or enlighten me of the error that development may proceed with greater speed.

May TRUTH find its way through these paths, and may time and chance permit it.
