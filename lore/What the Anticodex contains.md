The [[What the Anticodex is|Anticodex]] contains both *inherited* thoughts (drawn from any source) and *novel thoughts*, which may emerge either from the collision of pre-existing thoughts or from thoughts that suddenly appear in my mind.

As [[The system behind the Anticodex|the system is used to seek the most complete form of TRUTH]], its outputs are subject to [[On the creation of new coherent wholes#^sxzhr|gradual transformation overtime]] through the introduction of new content into already existing entries, whether in the form of support or contradiction, recursively benefitting each other.

This also means that some thoughts within it may, at times, be entirely erroneous. These are moments in which I humbly mistook the false for the true.

This incorrectness, or untruth, I assure you, will be preserved. It is in my interest that the Anticodex should capture and trace all developments, [[On the TRUTH of shards|regardless of their proximity to TRUTH]].

And since the system seeks to find the *most complete form of TRUTH* about any subject that interests me or crosses my mind, the Anticodex may contain **any topic** whatever. Every entry written within it has, in some way, touched my interest, and is thus equally important to me, without prejudice towards its complexity or simplicity. After all, it is uniquely mine; what may seem important to me may appear trivial to you, and vice versa.

And just as I hold no prejudice against complexity or simplicity, I hold none against my own beliefs too. This means that, in seeking the *most complete form of TRUTH*, I record every idea I encounter in the Anticodex, even if it does not align with my beliefs and stands in opposition to my convictions.

Perhaps, despite the Anticodex's branching into a multitude of subjects and contexts, all points will ultimately converge upon a single question I wish answered, a question I do not yet know, and may never know.
