This development is **perpetual**. Nothing in the [[What the Anticodex is|Anticodex]] can ever be deemed final, for every thought is a work in progress. Thus, you, the *observer*, may encounter thoughts that seem erroneous, or completely false. Should that occur, I ask only this: allow time, and [[ignoredraftThe Paths|the paths]], to do their work, or enlighten me of the error that development may proceed with greater speed.

May TRUTH find its way through these paths, and may time and chance permit it.
