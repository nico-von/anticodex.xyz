**Paths** are visual representations of the **connection of [[The Shards|shards]]**, designed to make it easier for the user to trace and follow relevant ideas across the system. Each shard and lore entry has a path that you may trace.

Paths show what thought a shard influences. This makes seemingly irrelevant or even opposing thoughts appear to somehow be connected.
