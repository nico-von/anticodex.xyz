[[The Sources|Sources]], broken into many parts(called [[The Shards|shards]]), are first collected into the [[What the Anticodex is|Anticodex]] as an **incoherent mass**. Yet a shard, when joined with and influenced by another, gains the power to form entirely **new, coherent wholes**.

## Shards and the Paths
Shards need other shards to carry forward the development that allows TRUTH to reach them and prevail. 

This progression unfolds as shards cast *new light* upon existing shards, refining them, altering their meaning, or declaring them false altogether. A new shard may thus **contradict**, **complement**, or **enlighten** another shard. This influence is made visible through [[The Paths|paths]]. ^sxzhr

## Towards the most complete form of TRUTH
By striving towards a perfect state(wherein it attains the most complete form of TRUTH), I shall at least be able to bring it ever closer to this form, despite its being an almost impossible quest. ^-nco8
