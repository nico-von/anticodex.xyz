Sources, broken into many parts, are collected into the Anticodex as an **incoherent mass**. Yet a shard, when joined to and influenced by another, acquires the power to form entirely **new, coherent wholes**.

## Shards and the Paths
Shards require other shards to carry forward the development that allows **TRUTH** to reach them and prevail. Such a perfect state, wherein a development of thought within the system attains absolute TRUTH, may seem impossible to reach, yet striving toward it fuels the charge that draws it ever nearer to this elusive and perhaps unattainable ideal. 

This progression unfolds as shards cast *new light* upon existing shards, refining them, altering their meaning, or declaring them false altogether. A new shard may thus **contradict**, **complement**, or **enlighten** another shard. This influence is made visible through [[The Paths|paths]].
