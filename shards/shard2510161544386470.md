In choosing [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English|'to have']] or [['to be' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have'|'to be']] in making the past tense in Italian, the action must directly be about motion, the doer moves

For example: '[['Ho' is 'I have' in Italian|Ho]] [['Guidare' is 'to drive' in Italian|guidato]]' is used rather than '[['Io sono', or 'sono', is 'I am' in Italian|Sono]] guidato' because driving directly refers to the controlling of the car, and only indirectly to the going from one place to another.
