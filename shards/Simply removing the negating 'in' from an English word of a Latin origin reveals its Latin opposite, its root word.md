Simply removing the [['In' is a prefix, like 'un', it negates the word it is attached to|negating 'in']] from an English word of a Latin origin reveals its Latin opposite, its root word


An example:
As [['Incredibile', from the transformation of 'Incredible', means 'Unbelievable' in Latin and Italian]], [[Removing the negating 'in' from 'incredibile' leaves the word 'credibile' which is Latin and Italian for 'believable']].
