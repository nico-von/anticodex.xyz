Like [[The 'v' letter often crossovers with the 'b' sound or letter and vice versa|'b' and 'v']], 'p' and 'f' often [[Words can be similar in meaning and form between languages or even within the same language with the difference of having the beginning consonant shifted to another consonant|shift into one another]] too.

Examples are:
1. A close example is [[An example of the shift between 'p' and 'f' is 'per' and 'for'|'per' and 'for']]
2. Another close example is [['Padre' is 'Father' in Italian|'Padre' and 'Father']]
3. A not very obvious example is [[The English word 'Fable' and the Italian word 'Parlare' are related through consonant shifting between 'f' and 'p'|'fable' and 'parlare']]
4. A German-English close example is [['Apfel' is 'Apple' in German|'Apfel' and 'Apple']]
