### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^2calc]]

It can slightly change the literal meaning of a word it follows:

For example, when used in conjunction with [['Tardi' is the Italian word for 'late'|'tardi']], it makes the Italian phrase for 'later', that is [['più tardi' is 'later' in Italian which is literally translated to 'more late'|'più tardi']]

Another, is [[In Italian, 'più grande' or 'più picolla' can be used to say 'older' or 'younger' when comparing ages|'più grande(or picolla)', it literally means 'more big(or small)' but it can mean 'older' or 'younger' depending on context]]

In contrast, [['meno' is 'less' in Italian]]

For saying the most or least: [[In Italian, to express 'the most' or 'the least', a definite article is placed before 'più' or 'meno' followed by the adjective]]
