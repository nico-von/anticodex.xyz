A verb that is [[Not every Italian 'to {verb}' form ending can be altered by a single letter alone to mark the subject who does the action. Others are irregular.|conjugated irregularly]] in the present does not mean it is conjugated irregularly in the past in Italian

Derived from example: [[Conjugating 'volere' is quite irregular as the endings are not simply replaced]] but it follows the [[Italian regular past continuous forms('was -ing')|regular past continuous forms]]
