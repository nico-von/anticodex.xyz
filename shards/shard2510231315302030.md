In Italian, there are [[Forming Past Participles in Italian|past participles]] that can be used as nouns if on the right gender. For example: getting the [[About feminine Italian words|feminine]] of [['visto' is an irregular past participle of 'vedere', along with the regular 'veduto'|the past participle of 'vedere' that is 'visto']], we get [['vista' means 'view' in Italian|'vista', meaning 'view']].
