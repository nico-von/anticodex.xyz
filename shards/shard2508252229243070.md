The 'c' in 'ci' or 'ce' in Italian is pronounced as 'ch'

### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^qxmu8]]

An exception to this rule applies to both 'ce' and 'ci' when spelled with an 's' directly before them: [[Having an 's' immediately before 'ce', as in 'sce', in Italian, gives the sound 'sh' rather than 'ch'|'sce' is pronounced as 'sh(e)']] [[Like 'sce', 'sci' also gives the sound 'sh(i)' in Italian|'sci' is pronounced as 'sh(i)']]
