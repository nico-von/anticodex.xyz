[['mia' or 'mio' is the possessive 'my' in Italian|'mio']] is made plural as [[The plural of the Italian possessive word 'mio' is 'miei'|'miei']] instead of 'mii'([[Most Italian words that end in '-o' or '-e' get their plural form by transforming these endings to '-i'|following the rule where words ending in 'o' have this ending transformed to an '-i' in their plural form]]), so as to separate the two consecutive 'i's that would otherwise be awkward to pronounce
### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^i-9ff]]

This is not always true for the plural of words ending in '-io' (an example is [['zii', 'zie', is the plural of 'zio', 'zia' in Italian|'zii', the plural of 'zio']])
