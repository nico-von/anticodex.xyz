In an Italian word which literal meaning is prefixed with [['Con' means 'with' in Italian|'with']], the 'n' in 'con' can adapt or assimilate to the consonant following it

An example is: [['Collaborare' is 'to collaborate' in Italian|'collaborare']] where the 'col-' prefixing it also means 'with'. This leaves 'laborare' or [['lavorare' is 'to work' in Italian|'lavorare' meaning 'to work']]. From this, [[Knowing the meaning of a part of a word can show clues to what the rest of the word means|the meaning can be easily inferred]]. 
### Excerpt

It follows that [[Some Italian words or perhaps even English words prefixed with 'co-' may indicate 'with' as well|some Italian words or perhaps even English words prefixed with '-co' may indicate 'with' as well]]

[[The assimilation of 'n' in  Italian words with their literal meaning prefixed with 'con' may as well be true for English, such as 'col' in 'collaborate'|This may also be true for English as 'collaborate' bears the same literal meaning]]
