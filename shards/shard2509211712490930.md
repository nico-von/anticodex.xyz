The '-i' ending of Italian nouns usually indicate a plural form. We can see how [[To get the plural of some Italian words, replace the ending vowel with '-i', like how 'lo' becomes 'li'|the ending vowel of nouns gets replaced with '-i']], or how [[To get the plural of Italian nouns ending in '-zione' simply change the ending 'e' with 'i', to '-zioni'|'zione' turns into 'zioni' to indicate a plural form]].
