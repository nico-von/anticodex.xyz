What is meant by putting yourself in the perspective of another player, is thinking what the other player is likely to do given what they know and do not know, what their motives are and what their motives are not. It is not thinking what you will be doing if you were them.

Hence, [[When thinking strategically, the perspective of other players must always be considered(anticipated) - their information, their motivation(motives), what they think of you, whether they're irrational. As you are playing against people, not machines]]
