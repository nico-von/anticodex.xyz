Masculine is the default gender in Italian for words whose gender cannot otherwise be determined

For example, referring to something with 'it' of which the gender of the word it is referring to cannot be determined through [[Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them naturally through the context or the circumstances surrounding what was said|context]], [['It' in Italian is 'lo'|'lo']] is to be used

Another example is [[The Italian word 'li' can be used to refer to a masculine group or a mixed group|using 'li', the masculine word for 'them', to refer to a mixed group(gender)]]
