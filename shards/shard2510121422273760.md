[['Pendente' means 'hanging' in Italian|'pendente', meaning 'hanging']], also means 'leaning' in Italian. This use can be seen in [['Torre pendente di Pisa' is 'Leaning tower of Pisa' in Italian|the Italian of 'leaning tower of Pisa', which is, 'torre pendente di Pisa']].  

Furthermore, it makes more sense for the literal meaning of [['Dipendente' literally means 'of hanging' in Italian|'dipendente', instead of 'of hanging']], to be 'of leaning'. ^m7318
