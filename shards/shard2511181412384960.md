In Italian, to express 'the most' or 'the least', a definite article(like [['Il' is Italian for 'the' (for singular masculine words)|'il']] or [['La' is Italian for 'the' (for singular feminine words)|'la']]) is placed before [['più' is the Italian word for 'more'|'più']] or [['meno' is 'less' in Italian|'meno']] followed by the adjective

For example: [[In Italian, 'più grande' or 'più picolla' can be used to say 'older' or 'younger' when comparing ages|'più grande' = older]] and 'il più grande' = 'oldest'
