Its placement is flexible.|'io']], are [[Italian words for adding emphasis to the doer of conjugated verbs|words for adding emphasis to the doer of conjugated verbs]] and both 'tu' and 'noi' are as well the words for the doer of the verbs they emphasise, then 'io', emphasising verbs where 'I' did the action, must also be the word for 'I'
