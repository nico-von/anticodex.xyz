[['Io' can be used for emphasis in sentences with verbs that already end in 'o' (if it signifies that the speaker refers to himself). Its placement is flexible.|'io']], like [['Tu' is the word for saying and emphasising 'you' in Italian|'tu']] and [['Noi' is for saying 'we' and adding emphasis to the doers referred to as 'we', often used with Italian verbs that end with '-iamo'|'noi']], are the words for the doer of the action of conjugated verbs, and are used for [[Italian words for adding emphasis to the doer of conjugated verbs|adding emphasis to that doer]]. For this case, 'Io' is for 'I'. An example is, when saying 'I am' in Italian, [['Io sono', or 'sono', is 'I am' in Italian|'io sono']] would be used.
