English speakers can begin learning Italian by 'exposing' the Latin side of English, using it as an 'entry point' and a 'mental anchor'.

### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianexcerptindex#^7kzqy]]

Entry points:
1. [[Latin words in English can be identified by the way they look]]

Transformations:
1. [[Most English words ending in 'al' can be 'transformed' to Italian by simply adding an 'e' to the end]]
2. [[English '-ly' adjectives need only have '-ly' replaced with '-mente' to transform to Italian]]
3. [[Most English words ending in 'ible' and 'able' can be transformed to Italian by changing them to 'ibile' and 'abile]]
4. [[Simply removing the negating 'in' from an English word of a Latin origin reveals its Latin opposite, its root word]]
5. [[Unlike 'English', 'it' comes before verbs like in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want']]
6. [[Most English verbs with noun forms ending in '-ation' can be transformed to Italian verbs by replacing their '-ation' suffix with '-are']]
