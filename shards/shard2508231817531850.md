Sometimes English words prepended with [['In' is a prefix, like 'un', it negates the word it is attached to|negating 'in']] are of Latin origin. 

For example: 

The English word [['Incredibile', from the transformation of 'Incredible', means 'Unbelievable' in Latin and Italian|'incredible' is of Latin origin]].

Also, since the negating 'in' has been talked about here, this reminds that [[Simply removing the negating 'in' from some English words of a Latin origin reveals its Latin opposite, its root word]].
