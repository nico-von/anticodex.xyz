In Italian, when [[An open 'e' sound, spelled 'è', in Italian means 'third person..is'|'è']] comes after [['come' is 'how' in Italian|come]], they are contracted to 'comè'

Much similar to how [[If a vowel follows 'la', it contracts with the word it follows, and the 'a' in 'la' is replaced by an apostrophe|when a vowel follows 'la', they are contracted and the 'a' of 'la' is replaced by am apostrophe]]
