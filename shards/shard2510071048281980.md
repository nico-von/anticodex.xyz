In Italian, when [[An open 'e' sound, spelled 'è', in Italian means 'third person..is'|'è']] comes after [['come' is 'how' in Italian|come]], they are [[In Italian, some words that are used in succession with certain words can be contracted together to form a single word|contracted]] to 'comè'

Much similar to how [[Like 'quando' 'cosa' can as well be combined with 'è ché' and contracted to 'cosè ché'|'cosa' and 'è ché' can be shortened to 'cosè ché']], [[The Italian phrase 'Quando è ché' can be contracted to just 'Quandèché'|'Quando è ché' to 'Quandèché']] and [[In Italian, if a vowel follows 'la', it contracts with the word it follows, and the 'a' in 'la' is replaced by an apostrophe|when a vowel follows 'la', they are contracted and the 'a' of 'la' is replaced by am apostrophe]]
