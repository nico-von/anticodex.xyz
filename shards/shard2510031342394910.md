Notice [[In Italian, saying 'my' or 'your' or any other possessive sometimes does not follow 'the {possessive} {noun}' form, especially for some fixed expressions, in such cases, the possessive is placed after the noun without the article|how it doesn't use the form 'la mia mama']] compared to saying 'my friend': [[To say 'my friend' in Italian, 'il mio amico' can be used, literally, 'The my friend'|'il mio amico']]
