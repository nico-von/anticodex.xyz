The 'v' sound [[Words can be similar in meaning and form between languages or even within the same language with the difference of having the beginning consonant shifted to another consonant|often crossovers]] with the 'b' sound and vice versa. Like how the 'v' in the Italian word [['Lavorare' is 'to work' in Italian|'lavorare']] becomes 'b' in [['Collaborare' is 'to collaborate' in Italian|'collaborare']], or [['Devo', 'devi', to 'dobbiamo' shows the 'v' to 'b' shift in Italian|'devo', 'devi', when conjugated to say 'we', becomes 'dobbiamo']], and how [[in Spanish, the 'v' letter often becomes a 'b' sound|in Spanish, the 'v' letter often becomes a 'b' sound]], and [[The greek letter β or Β is pronounced with the 'v' sound|the Greek letter β or Β is pronounced with the 'v' sound]]. It is present [[The 'v' to 'b' conversion can happen in English too, like 'labour'|in English too]].

[[The English 'debt' and the Italian 'devo' is an example of a 'b' to 'v' crossover|Another example of 'b' to 'v' crossover is the English 'debt' and the Italian 'devo']]

Perhaps because [[Perhaps, like assimilation, the crossover between the sounds v and b arises from ease of speech since the b sound is very close to the v, and some speakers find it easier to reach for b in place of v.|like assimilation, the crossover between the sounds v and b arises from ease of speech since the b sound is very close to the v, and some speakers find it easier to reach for b in place of v.]]
