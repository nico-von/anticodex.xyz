The 'v' sound often crossovers with the 'b' sound and vice versa. Like how the 'v' in the Italian word [['Lavorare' is 'to work' in Italian|'lavorare']] becomes 'b' in [['Collaborare' is 'to collaborate' in Italian|'collaborare']] and how [[in Spanish, the 'v' letter often becomes a 'b' sound|in Spanish, the 'v' letter often becomes a 'b' sound]], and [[The greek letter β or Β is pronounced with the 'v' sound|the Greek letter β or Β is pronounced with the 'v' sound]]. It is present [[The 'v' to 'b' conversion can happen in English too, like 'labour'|in English too]]. 
### Excerpt

[[The English 'debt' and the Italian 'devo' is an example of a 'b' to 'v' crossover|Another example of 'b' to 'v' crossover is the English 'debt' and the Italian 'devo']]

Perhaps, like assimilation, this is to pronounce the word 'b' sound is very similar to 'v' sound, and it is easier to reach for the 'b' sound for certain speakers
