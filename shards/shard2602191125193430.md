Past tense

With past participles:
[[The 'past participle' forms of certain Italian verbs are flexible that they can be used as nouns, past of verbs or adjectives]]

Verbs of motion and when verbs are done to oneself: [['essere' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have']], [[In Italian, 'essere' is used to express actions of the past with verbs where the person does the action to themselves]]

Other verbs: [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English]]

Regular continuous, i.e. 'He/she/it was…-ing': [[Italian regular past continuous forms('was -ing')]]

[[Italian Compound Tenses]]:

1. Past perfect: [['erano' is used with a verb's(movement verb, or a verb action done to oneself) past participle to indicate an action completed before another past action (Italian past perfect)]]
