In languages of Latin origin, at least in Italian and in English, it appears the Latin root of 'monster' was used for some words related to 'showing'. This can be seen from examples like [['Dimostrare' literally means 'from monster'|'dimostrare']] and 'demonstrate', and in other [[English words like 'monitor', 'admonish' and 'money' uses the same root for 'monster' as in the Italian 'to show' or 'monstrare'|English words like 'monitor', 'admonish' and 'money']]. This shows the significance of [[A 'monster' was once considered an omen, sign, message from the Gods|'monster' having once been considered an omen, sign, message from the Gods]].
