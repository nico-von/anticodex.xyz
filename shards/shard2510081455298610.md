	2. [['Qual è' or 'Quali sono' are used for asking 'what in particular' in Italian]]
5. Ordinal numbers: [[Ordinal numbers in Italian match the gender of the noun they refer to]]

When the ending of a verb's past participle changes when used as a past tense:
1. [[In Italian, the ending of past participles used with 'To be' are changed according to the gender(or number) of the doer]]
2. [[In Italian, when a direct object pronoun precedes a past tense formed with 'avere', the verb's past participle changes its ending to match the gender of the pronoun]]
