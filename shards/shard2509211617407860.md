The 'e' sound of the Italian word [[An open 'e' sound, spelled 'è', in Italian means 'third person..is'|'è']] when distinguishing it with that of [['ché' is both 'what' and 'that' in Italian|'ché']] varies differently between dialects.

For example: [[Italian speakers from the South tend to pronounce the 'e' sound of 'è' and 'ché' in the same way]]

This distinction is not as important as [[It is important to distinguish between the 'e' sound of the Italian words 'è' and 'e'|the distinction of the 'e' sound between 'è' and 'e']] that is [[The difference of the 'e' sound between the Italian words 'è' and 'e' is important across all Italian dialects|important across all dialects of Italian]].
