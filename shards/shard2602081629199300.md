A 'dominant strategy' is when a player's best strategy never changes no matter what strategy the other players play

[[The outcome in a dominant strategy is that the player always gets the relative best payoff(guaranteed) of each situation and not the absolute best payoff(i.e. The highest reward)]]

[[In a 'prisoner's dilemma', both players have access to a dominant strategy, which leads to a guaranteed but lower 'payoff' than if the players cooperate for a bigger payoff. However, unlike 'the dominant strategy', this outcome is not guaranteed|A dominant strategy is not limited to one player in a game.]]
