In Italian, if two pronouns(such as [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|direct object pronouns]]) receive actions from a single verb(such a verb in its [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|'to {verb}' form)]], the pronouns must be combined together into a single form or word

For example: '[['ci' is 'us', 'each other', 'one another', 'ourselves' in Italian|ci]] [['La' is the feminine form of 'it' in Italian|la]]' becomes 'cela'

Notice, from the above example, 'ci', became 'ce'! The reason for this is [[Pronouns are combined and pronounced slightly differently in Italian for ease|ease of pronunciation]]

[[In Italian, when combining two direct object pronouns together, 'mi' becomes 'me', 'ti' becomes 'te, and 'ci' becomes 'ce'|This shift of 'ci' to 'ce' also applies to 'mi' and 'ti', becoming 'me' and 'te']]

And [[In Italian, when combining pronouns into a single form, the pronoun referring to people must stand first]]
