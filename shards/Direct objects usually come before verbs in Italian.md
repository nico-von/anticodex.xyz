From observation of various cases like:
1. [[Unlike 'English', 'it', as a direct object, comes before verbs in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want']]
2. [['you' or  'ti', as a direct object, comes before verbs in Italian]]

Perhaps, [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|'direct objects']] usually come before verbs in Italian.
