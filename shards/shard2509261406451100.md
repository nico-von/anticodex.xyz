'tua' is the Italian feminine word for 'your' 

An example is 'la tua amica' meaning 'your friend([[The Italian for 'friend' is 'amico' for male, and 'amica' for female|'amica']])'. This sentence is similar to [[To say 'my friend' in Italian, 'il mio amico' can be used, literally, 'The my friend'|il mio amico]] where it uses [[In Italian, to say that something possesses something else, the form 'the {possessive}' is generally used|the form, 'the {possessive}', ]] that starts with a [['La' is Italian for 'the'|'the'(la)]] causing it to literally mean as: 'the your friend'.
