In Italian, when using [['So' is 'I know' in Italian|'so']], if a direct object is already expressed, [[When saying 'I know' in Italian, it cannot be translated directly, as 'so' cannot be used by itself, 'it' must also be included, as in 'I know it' or 'lo so'|'lo' is no longer required.]]

An example would be: 'Non so [['Se' is 'if' in Italian|se]] [['I can' or 'I am able' is 'posso' in Italian|posso]] [['Venire' is 'to come' in Italian|venire]]' or 'I don't know if I can come'
