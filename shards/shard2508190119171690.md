In Italian, words must be clearly pronounced as they may lead to misunderstanding. For example: [[An open 'e' sound in Italian means 'third person..is']] while [[A weaker and closed 'e' sound in Italian means 'and']].

Therefore, these pronunciation rules must be followed:
1. [[Italian words, unlike English words, are usually pronounced as they are written|Italian words are usually pronounced as they are written]] unlike [[In English pronunciation, patterns of Germanic accent are present, whereby the first syllable is usually stressed and the rest are not|in English where some syllables are stressed while others are not]]
2. [[In Italian, each vowel must be pronounced]]
3. [[The 'c' in 'ci' or 'ce' in Italian is pronounced as 'ch']]
4. [[Double consonants in Italian must be pronounced longer, acting as voiced pauses]]
5. [[Misplacing accents on an Italian word can change its meaning, 'lavoro' can mean 'he worked' instead of 'I work' if accented incorrectly]]
