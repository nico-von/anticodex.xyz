In Italian, words must be clearly pronounced as they may lead to misunderstanding. For example: [[An open 'e' sound, spelled 'è', in Italian means 'third person..is']] while [[A weaker and closed 'e' sound in Italian means 'and']].

Therefore, these pronunciation rules must be followed:
1. [[Italian words, unlike English words, are usually pronounced as they are written|Italian words are usually pronounced as they are written]] unlike [[In English pronunciation, patterns of Germanic accent are present, whereby the first syllable is usually stressed and the rest are not|in English where some syllables are stressed while others are not]]
2. [[In Italian, each vowel must be pronounced]]
3. [[The 'c' in 'ci' or 'ce' in Italian is pronounced as 'ch']]
4. [[Having an 's' immediately before 'ce', as in 'sce', in Italian, gives the sound 'sh' rather than 'ch']] and [[Like 'sce', 'sci' also gives the sound 'sh(i)' in Italian]]
5. [[Double consonants in Italian must be pronounced longer, acting as voiced pauses]]
6. [[Misplacing accents on an Italian word can change its meaning, 'lavoro' can mean 'he worked' instead of 'I work' if accented incorrectly]]
7. [[The vowel sound 'i' is sometimes pronounced less distinctly when it follows the vowel sound 'o' in Italian, producing the sound 'yo' rather than the distinct 'i-o', as in the pronunciation of 'giorno']]
8. [[The single letter 's' between vowels in Italian words can be pronounced as 'Z' in some dialects]]
9. [[It is important to distinguish between the 'e' sound of the Italian words 'è' and 'e']]
10. [['ch' in Italian is pronounced as a hard 'kh' sound]]
11. [[Italian 'to {verb}' forms are mostly stressed on the penultimate syllable or second to the last syllable]] while a few, like [['Vendere' is 'to sell' in Italian|'vendere']] are [[Some Italian 'to {verb}' verb forms are stressed on their third from the last syllable|stressed on their third from the last syllable]]
