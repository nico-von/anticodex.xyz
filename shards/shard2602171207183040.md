The disadvantages of [[The 'Tit for tat' strategy is to cooperate first and then to copy what others have done to you in the previous period|'tit for tat']]:
1. [['tit for tat' does not 'beat' the other player, hence, it will not win in a winner-take-all situation, it will only result to losses and ties]]
2. [[That in 'tit for tat', an infinite loop of defections is possible as it does not let defections happen unpunished. This could happen for instance if the opponent always defects, or if the opponent practises tit for tat too.]]
3. [[That even a small chance of error or misperception can cause 'tit for tat' to collapse entirely making it not ideal for the real world as, real world interactions inevitably involve mistakes]]


And [[The advantages of 'tit for tat' - that it never gets left behind, that it encourages cooperation]]
