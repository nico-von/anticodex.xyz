In attaching a pronoun to the end of a verb with an '-are' form, the 'e' is removed and replaced with the pronoun (as the 'e' is no longer needed because the pronoun [[A 'phonetic habit' of Italian is that most words tend to end in vowels.|already ends in a vowel]])

The same is true with [[The 'e' added to transformed words is lost when adding 'mente' because 'mente' already ends in a vowel|transformed words]].
