Saying 'do you want to come to eat?' literally becomes 'do you want to come, **to**, to eat?' in Italian, '[['Vuoi' is 'you want' in Italian|vuoi]] [['Venire' is 'to come' in Italian|venire]] [['a' is the locational, directional, 'to' in Italian|a]] [['Mangiare' is 'to eat' in Italian|mangiare]]?'

This is because [[In Italian, 'a' often links a verb of movement to a 'to {verb}' verb form, indicating that the motion is directed toward performing the second action]]
