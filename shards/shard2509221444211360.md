In an Italian phrase, it can be observed from the English meanings of Italian words, that when you have a [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|'to {verb}' form]] together with a [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|direct object pronoun]], despite the [[The placement of direct object pronouns in Italian are subject to these rules|direct object pronoun's placement]], the pronoun is by default understood to receive its action from that 'to {verb}' form

An example is 'Voglio vederlo - [[In Italian, 'Voglio' means 'I want'|voglio]](I want) [['Vedere' is the Italian word for 'to see'|veder]](to see) [['It' in Italian is 'lo'|lo]](it)' where the direct object pronoun 'lo' clearly receives action from 'vedere' or 'to see', and not from 'voglio'. The same is true for anther form that conveys the same meaning: 'Lo voglio vedere' whereby [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together#^r-pfk|'lo' was optionally placed in front of 'voglio']].

And [[If a 'to {verb}' verb form is present and another conjugated verb seems to point to the direct object pronoun too, that verb is instead understood to be pointing to the 'to {verb}' form with the direct object together]].
