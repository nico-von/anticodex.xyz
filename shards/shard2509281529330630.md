Because [['Scappare' and the English word for it 'escape' shares the same word origin|'escape' and 'scappare' share the same word origin]] and [[The English word 'escape' or 'to escape' is related with the word 'cape', whereby the meaning behind it was to get away from a pursuer leaving only one's cape behind|'cape' in 'escape' literally refers to 'cape']], the 'cappa', from [['Scappare' is 'to escape' in Italian|'scappare']], must refer to 'cape' in Italian

And since [[The English word 'cape' is also related with the 'cap' root meaning 'head'|the 'cap' in 'cape' is related with 'head']] it should go the same for 'cappa' too as they are very similar
