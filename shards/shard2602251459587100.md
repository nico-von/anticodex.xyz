A powerful programming language should be able to combine simple ideas to create complex ideas by providing [[Primitive expressions are the representations of the simplest things a language is concerned with|primitive expressions]](primitive functions and data), [[Means of combination are the mechanisms that enable compound things to be built from simpler ones|means of combination]] and [[Means of abstraction are the mechanisms that enable compound things(from simple things) to be named and manipulated as a single unit|means of abstraction]]. This is because it is not only used as a way to instruct the computer, but it is where ideas about processes are organised.
