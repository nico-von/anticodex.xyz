As, [[In an Italian word which literal meaning is prefixed with 'with', the 'n' in 'con' can adapt or assimilate to the consonant following it, like 'col-' in 'collaborare']], it follows that some Italian words or perhaps even [[The assimilation of 'n' in  Italian words with their literal meaning prefixed with 'con' may as well be true for English, such as 'col' in 'collaborate'|English words prefixed with '-co']] may indicate 'with' as well.
