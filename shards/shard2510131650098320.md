Sometimes, in Italian, forming the [[In Italian, knowing one form of a word, such as its '-ing' adjective form, often allows one to identify its verb or past participle as well, and vice versa, provided that the rules for transforming between them are known by working backwards#^v3nar|'past participle']] involves a slight spelling change beyond the usual replacements

Observed from this following example: [['Conoscere' is 'to know'(someone), or 'to meet'(for the first time) in Italian|'conoscere', meaning 'to know']] becomes [['Conosciuto' is 'known' in Italian|'Conosciuto', meaning 'known']] rather than simply 'conoscuto'
