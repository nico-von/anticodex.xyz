Sometimes, in Italian, [[Forming Past Participles in Italian|forming the past participle]] involves a slight spelling change beyond the usual replacements

Observed from this following example: [['Conoscere' is 'to know'(someone), or 'to meet'(for the first time) in Italian|'conoscere', meaning 'to know']] becomes [['Conosciuto' is 'known' in Italian|'Conosciuto', meaning 'known']] rather than simply 'conoscuto'

An even more irregular example is [['visto' is an irregular past participle of 'vedere', along with the regular 'veduto'|'visto']] from [['Vedere' is the Italian word for 'to see'|'vedere']]
