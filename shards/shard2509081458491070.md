[[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are' or '-ere' at the Italian verb's ending|Italian 'to {verb}' forms]] can be changed to an ending in [[The 'o' in 'devo' indicates that it refers to the speaker|'-o' to indicate that the speaker is doing the action of the verb]].

See the following for verb ending specific (single letter) transformations:
1. [[To transform an '-are' verb form to something where the speaker describes that he is doing the verb, the '-are' must first be removed, and then replaced with 'o' that indicates 'I']]
2. [[The speaker can indicate that he is doing the action of the '-ere' verb form by replacing '-ere' with 'o']]

However, perhaps [[Not every Italian 'to {verb}' form ending can be altered by a single letter alone to mark the subject who does the action.]]
