When we say penultimate syllable, we mean the second to the last syllable. 

(This definition is derived from [[Italian 'to {verb}' forms are mostly stressed on the penultimate syllable or second to the last syllable|the rule that most 'to {verb}' forms are stressed on the penultimate syllable or second to the last syllable]].)
