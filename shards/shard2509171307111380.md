As [[The shifting of beginning consonants in words with great similarity between languages usually happens between very similar sounds, like 'b' and 'v'|the shifting of beginning consonants in words with great similarity between languages usually happens between similar sounds, like 'b' and 'v']], this means they can happen to sounds that SEEM DISSIMILAR too.

An example is [[Like 'b' and 'v', 'p' and 'f' often shift into one another too|'p' and 'f']] (Do note, however, that SEEM DISSIMILAR was highlighted because [['p' and 'f' seem similar, or at least close to me, but it appears to seem dissimilar to other speakers|while 'p' and 'f' seem dissimilar to other speakers, 'p' and 'f' seem similar to me]])
