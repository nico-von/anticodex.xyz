In Italian, to form the past participle of verbs ending in [['-ire' is another 'to {verb}' form ending|'-ire']], simply replace '-ire' with '-ito' or '-ita'

For example:
[['capire' means 'to understand' in Italian|'capire', 'to understand']] becomes [['Capito' is 'understood' in Italian|'capito', 'understood']]

However, [['Venuto' is the past participle of 'venire'|'venire' is an exception, as it becomes 'venuto']]

Also, [[Sometimes, in Italian, forming the past participle involves a slight spelling change beyond the usual replacements, making them quite irregular]]
