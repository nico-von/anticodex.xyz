'niente' is 'anything' in Italian if the sentence is negative(indicated usually by the presence of [['Non' means 'not' in Italian and often added before verbs to negate them|'non']])

Otherwise, it means [['niente' is 'nothing' in Italian|'nothing']]
### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^ssf56]]

The reason being: [['Niente' is 'anything' when the sentence is negative (presence of something like 'non') because 'non...niente', or 'not...nothing', is logically 'anything'|as 'non...niente', or 'not...nothing', is logically 'anything']]
