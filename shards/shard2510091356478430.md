![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^kka0n]]

[['Io sono', or 'sono', is 'I am' in Italian|'Sono' also means 'I am']]. For clarifying intent, additonal context may be added, such as adding [[Italian words for adding emphasis to the doer of conjugated verbs|emphasis]] for [['Loro' is 'they' and for emphasis of 'they' in Italian|'they' that is: 'Loro']]
 (See the [[The different conjugations of 'to be'('essere') in Italian|other conjugations of the Italian word for 'to be']].)

[['erano' is the past tense of 'sono' in Italian]] and [['saranno' is the future tense of 'sono' in Italian]]
