From various cases like:
1. [[Unlike 'English', 'it', as a direct object, usually comes before verbs that point to it in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want']]
2. [['you' or  'ti', as a direct object, can come before verbs that point to it in Italian]]

It can be observed that [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|'direct object']] pronouns usually come before [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|the verb that points to them]] in Italian.

Indeed, this is [[Direct object pronouns in Italian MUST be in front of a verb that points its action to it if there is not an '-are' verb form to which it can be attached|a MUST if there is not an '-are' verb form to attach the direct pronoun]]

However, if there exists such a verb, there is also an [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its '-are' form is optional if another verb pointing to it exists|option]] to put the [[If a verb is in its '-are' form, direct object pronouns can be attached to the end of it|'direct object' pronoun at the end of it]]

If, however, [[If there is only an '-are' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end|only an '- are' verb form exists, the direct object pronoun can only be placed at the end.]] See [[The placement of direct object pronouns in Italian are subject to these rules|these placement rules]] for further clarification.
