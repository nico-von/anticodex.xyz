As it was established that [['Venir' means 'come' in French]], 'sous' should mean 'below' in French, as it makes up the word [['Souvenir' is 'memory' in French, literally meaning, from the French words 'sous' and 'venir', 'come from below'|'souvenir', that literally means 'come from below' in French]].
