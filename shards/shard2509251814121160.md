Sometimes, transforming an Italian word to its plural form needs more than simply changing its ending. 

For example, it is not enough to simply change the ending 'a' of [[The Italian for 'friend' is 'amico' for male, and 'amica' for female|'amica']] to [[We can get the plural of most Italian words ending in '-a' by replacing '-a' with '-e'|an 'e']].
