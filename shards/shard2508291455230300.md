To understand the meaning behind these rules, remember that direct object pronouns are [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|what directly receives the action of a verb]]. 

Remember too, that [[In an Italian phrase, it can be observed that when you have a 'to {verb}' form together with a direct object pronoun, despite the direct object pronoun's location, the pronoun is by default understood to receive its action from that 'to {verb}' form|in an Italian phrase, when you have a 'to {verb}' form together with a direct object pronoun, the pronoun is by default understood to receive its action from that 'to {verb}' form.]] And [[If a 'to {verb}' verb form is present and another conjugated verb seems to point to the direct object pronoun too, that verb is instead understood to be pointing to the 'to {verb}' form with the direct object together]]. 

The placement rules of direct object pronouns are thus:
1. [[Direct object pronouns in Italian MUST be in front of the conjugated verb that points its action to them, if there is no 'to {verb}' verb form that points to them and to which it can be attached]]
2. [[If there is only an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end]]
3. [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together]]
4. [[In Italian, especially when there are two or more 'to {verb}' verb forms present, a direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the 'to {verb}' form it directly receives action from]]
