The placement of direct object pronouns are subject to these rules:
1. [[Direct object pronouns in Italian MUST be in front of a verb that points its action to it if there is not an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form to which it can be attached]]
2. [[If there is only an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end]]
3. [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together]]
