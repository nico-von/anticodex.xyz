The Italian word 'sapere' is related to 'Sapien' in 'Homo Sapien'. 

This is because [['Sapere' is 'to know'(information) in Italian|'Sapere' means knowing some knowledge or information]] while 'Homo Sapien' means something like a 'wise being'. Furthermore, both 'sapien' and 'sapere' both starts with 'sap'!
