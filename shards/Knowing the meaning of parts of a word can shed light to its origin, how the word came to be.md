Knowing the meaning of parts of a word can shed light to its origin, how the word came to be
### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianexcerptindex#^28m3e]]

For instance, [[Some English words with the prefix 'con-' use it to mean 'with', similar to the Italian 'con', as in the word 'conform'|the prefix 'con-' in the word 'conform' literally means 'with', the entire word literally meaning 'with form']]. 


Another is [['Complicate' literally means 'with folding' in Italian|complicate]], the prefix [[Like 'con-', 'com-' also means 'with'|'com']], also meaning 'with', literally means 'with folding'. And as the opposite of 'complicate' is 'simple', interestingly, [[Simple-mindedness is 'einfalt', in German, which literally means 'One fold'|the German word for 'simple-minded' is 'einfalt' which literally means 'one fold']]
