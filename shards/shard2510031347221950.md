In Italian, to say that something possesses something else, the form 'the {possessive}' is generally used

For example: [[To say 'my friend' in Italian, 'il mio amico' can be used, literally, 'The my friend'|to say 'my friend', we use, 'il mio amico']], or, to say, 'your house, we can use, ' [['tua' is the Italian feminine word for 'your'|la tua]] [['casa' is 'house' in Italian|casa(house)]]'.

Sometimes, [[In Italian, phrases using the form 'the {possessive}'(like 'la tua' or 'il mio') may stand alone without the noun they possess, for it is already implied by context|if the context makes the noun clear, the form 'the {possessive}' can stand by itself without the noun]]

However, [[In Italian, saying 'my' or 'your' or any other possessive sometimes does not follow 'the {possessive} {noun}' form, especially for some fixed expressions, in such cases, the possessive is placed after the noun without the article|sometimes, especially for fixed expressions, the form '{noun} {possessive}' is, instead, used]]
