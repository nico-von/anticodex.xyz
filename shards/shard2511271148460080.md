When talking about the hour in Italian, [[As most Italian words ending in '-a' can be made plural by changing it into an '-e', 'la', in its plural form, becomes 'le'|'le']] + '[[List of numbers in Italian|number]]' is used

That is why, [['Alle {hours}' is used to tell the hour in Italian because when we say it is '{hours} o' clock', what is really being said is 'at {hour} hours', 'le' in 'alle' implies, through context, 'hours' which is feminine and plural|'Alle {hours}' is used to tell the hour in Italian because when we say it is '{hours} o' clock', what is really being said is 'at {hour} hours']]
