The ending '(-a,e,i)va' in Italian verbs indicates the third person singular past tense

(derived from [['guidava' is the past tense of 'guida' in Italian]], [['aveva' is the past tense of 'ha' in Italian]], [['stava' is the past tense of 'sta' in Italian]])

Unlike using [['to be' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have'|'essere']] or [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English|'avere']], using this form is like saying 'he was {verb}ing' rather than 'he {verb}ed'
