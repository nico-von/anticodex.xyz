You may ask directly in Italian, letting [[Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them naturally through the context or the circumstances surrounding what was said|context]] and tone of voice carry the intent, without needing to frame the request with 'can you' or [['puoi' is 'you can' in Italian|'puoi']]

An example: Instead of using 'puoi darmi il tuo libro' or 'can you [['dare' is 'to give' in Italian|give(dare)]] [['Mi' is 'myself' in Italian|me(mi)]] [['tuo' is the Italian masculine word for 'your'|your(il tuo)]] [['Libro' is 'book' in Italian|book(libro)]]?' you can just say 'mi dai il tuo libro?' '[['dai' is 'you give' in Italian|you give(dai)]] me your book?'
