### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^a23ob]]

[[In Italian, it is common to use trovare 'to find' instead of vedere 'to see' when saying 'to come and see']]

Also, [['trovare' can be used as the figurative 'found' as in 'do you find it...do you think it' in Italian]]

And [['cerca' is 'he, she or it searches' in Italian]]
