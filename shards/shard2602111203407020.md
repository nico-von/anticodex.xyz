Future Perfect

Past perfect
1. [['erano' is used with a verb's(movement verb, or a verb action done to oneself) past participle to indicate an action completed before another past action (Italian past perfect)]]

Present perfect
1. [[In Italian, when a direct object pronoun precedes a past tense formed with 'avere', the verb's past participle changes its ending to match the gender of the pronoun]]
2. [['essere' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have']]
3. [[In Italian, 'essere' is used to express actions of the past with verbs where the person does the action to themselves]]
