Unlike 'English', [['It' in Italian is 'lo'|'it']], as a [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|'direct object']], [[Direct object pronouns in Italian usually come before the conjugated verb that points to them|usually comes before conjugated verbs that point to it]] in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want'

### Excerpt

This is [[Direct object pronouns in Italian MUST be in front of the conjugated verb that points its action to them, if there is no 'to {verb}' verb form that points to them and to which it can be attached|necessary if no 'to {verb}' verb form exists]]

There is also an [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together|option]] to [[If a verb is in its Italian 'to {verb}' form, direct object pronouns can be attached to the end of it|put 'lo' at the end of a verb if the verb is in its 'to {verb}' form]]

But [[If there is only an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end|if only a 'to {verb}' form exists, 'lo' can only be placed at the end of it.]] See [[The placement of direct object pronouns in Italian are subject to these rules|these direct pronoun placement rules]] for further clarification.

Nevertheless, [[Negation comes before 'it' in Italian, instead of saying 'I do not want it', it becomes, 'not it I want' or 'non lo voglio']]
