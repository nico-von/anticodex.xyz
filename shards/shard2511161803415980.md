In Italian, when [[A weaker and closed 'e' sound in Italian means 'and'|'e'(meaning 'and')]] precedes an 'e sound' (for example [[In Italian, when 'e' precedes 'è', 'e' becomes 'ed'|'e è' becomes 'ed è']]) it becomes 'ed'

Perhaps because: [['Mio' is made plural as 'miei' instead of 'mii', so as to separate the two consecutive 'i's that would otherwise be awkward to pronounce|like how an 'e' is inserted between the to 'i's of 'miei' so as not to be awkward to pronounce]]
