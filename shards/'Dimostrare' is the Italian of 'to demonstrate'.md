'Dimostrare' is the Italian of 'to demonstrate'

### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianignorecopyrightexcerptindex#^pddy3]]

Interestingly, [['Dimostrare' literally means 'from monster']], because a 'monster', or, [['Mostro' is Italian for 'monster'|'mostro']], [[A 'monster' was once considered an omen, sign, message from the Gods|used to be considered a sign from the Gods, as if to show or demonstrate a message]]. In fact, [['To show' is 'mostrare' in Italian|'to show' is 'mostrare' in Italian]], derived from the same, but now without the [['di' is the Italian for 'of' or 'from'|'di']]. It appears that [[In languages of Latin origin, at least in Italian and in English, the Latin root of 'monster' was used for some words related to 'showing']]
