Like [[Conjugating 'volere' is quite irregular as the endings are not simply replaced|'vuoi', 'puoi' is quite an irregular]] transformation or [[Verb conjugations to indicate the doer of the action in Italian|conjugation]]. This means its underlying verb is [[Not every Italian 'to {verb}' form ending can be altered by a single letter alone to mark the subject who does the action. Others are irregular.|irregular]].

It still shows the [[Some Italian verbs that end in '-i' indicates 'you'|ending '-i' that indicates the doer is the person the speaker is talking to]]. 

While, [['I can' or 'I am able' is 'posso' in Italian|'I can', is, 'posso']], and [['possiamo' is the Italian for 'we can'|'we can' is 'possiamo']], sharing the same root.
