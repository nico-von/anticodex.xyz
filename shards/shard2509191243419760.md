Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them, of course, through 'context' or the circumstances surrounding what was said

An example would be the Italian word 'lavoro', if the 'context' was that of an action, it means [['Lavoro' means 'I work' or 'I am working'|'I work']], while if the 'context' was that of a noun, it means [[The Italian word 'Lavoro' means 'job' as a noun|'job']]

### Excerpt

Hence, to convey the right meaning, using the right words([['Conoscere' is 'to know'(someone), or 'to meet'(for the first time) in Italian|'conoscere']] and [['Sapere' is 'to know'(information) in Italian|'sapere']] for example, both means 'to know', but differ in the meaning they convey)

In spoken conversations, the [[In Italian, words must be clearly pronounced as they may lead to misunderstanding|pronunciation]] and [[Misplacing accents on an Italian word can change its meaning, 'lavoro' can mean 'he worked' instead of 'I work' if accented incorrectly|accent]] is crucial for delivering the right meaning.
