Words can be exactly the same but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them, of course, through 'context' or the circumstances surrounding what was said

An example would be the Italian word 'lavoro', if the 'context' was that of an action, it means [['Lavoro' means 'I work' or 'I am working'|'I work']], while if the 'context' was that of a noun, it means [[The Italian word 'Lavoro' means 'job' as a noun|'job']]
