'Conoscere' can be recognised from the word 'recognise' because 'recognising' is 're-knowing' or to 'know([['Conoscere' is 'to know'(someone), or 'to meet'(for the first time) in Italian|a person, as in the definition of 'conoscere']]) again'. 

Also, the way 'recognising' is spelled is very close to 're-conoscere'
