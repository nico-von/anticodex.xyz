When making decisions, the aims of others must be considered (as [[Every decision one makes is directly or indirectly influenced, either positively or negatively, by the decisions or aims of others]]). If conflicting, anticipate it, if coinciding, utilise cooperation.

For instance, [[Sometimes it is best to wait for others to bear the risk then follow either immediately or only after success is proven(when reputation is at stake). This way you can capitalise without paying the cost of failure.|waiting for others to bear the risk(instead of leading the way) saves you from paying the cost of failure]]
