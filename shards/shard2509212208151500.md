Repeating words within a sentence, like having 'la' mentioned twice, is applicable in Italian as some words [[Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them naturally through the context or the circumstances surrounding what was said|can be identical]] yet serve different roles at once

For example: '[['Quando' is 'When' in Italian|Quando]] [['La' is the feminine form of 'it' in Italian|la(serving the role for 'the direct object it')]] vedi [['La' is Italian for 'the'|la(serving the fole for 'the')]] casa'â€¦ Meaning 'When do you see it? The house?'
