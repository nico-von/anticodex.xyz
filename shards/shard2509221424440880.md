In Italian, especially when there are two or more [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|'to {verb}']] verb forms present, a [[A list of Italian direct object pronouns|direct object pronoun]] should only be [[If a verb is in its Italian 'to {verb}' form, direct object pronouns can be attached to the end of it|attached to the end of a 'to {verb}']]form it directly receives action from

For example, in placing the direct object pronoun [['you' in Italian is 'ti'|'ti']] in a phrase like [['fare vedere', literally 'to make see' is the colloquial way of saying 'to show' in Italian|'fare vedere', meaning to show]], the 'ti' should be attached to 'fare', becoming 'farti vedere' (meaning [['fare' is the Italian word for 'to do' or 'to make'|'to make you]] to see'). Attaching it to 'vedere', turning it to 'vederti', makes the meaning incorrect as 'fare vederti' means 'to make [['Vedere' is the Italian word for 'to see'|to see you]]'.
