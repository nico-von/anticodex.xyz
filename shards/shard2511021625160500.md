In Italian, like [['essere' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have'|expressing the past of verbs of motion]], [['Essere' is 'to be' in Italian|'essere']] (and not [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English|'avere']]) is used to express actions of the past with verbs where the person does the action to themselves(used in conjunction with [[In Italian, 'si' is used to refer to oneself(in the third person) when a subject does the action on themselves|'si']] ) 

For example: [[An illustration of the 'si essere {verb}' form in Italian - 'si è tolto' is used to say 'he took it off(from himself)' while 'ha tolto' is used to say 'he took it off(not from himself)']]
