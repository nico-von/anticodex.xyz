Taken from the observations of [['Complicate' literally means 'with folding' in Italian|'complicate' literally meaning 'with folding']] in Italian, and the [[Simple-mindedness is 'einfalt', in German, which literally means 'One fold'|German word for simple-mindedness literally meaning 'one fold']] it appears as though 'fold' signifies layers of complexity. One fold means one layer, few to almost no complexity, while many folds, 'with folding', shows increased complexity. Ah, this reminds me of [['Manifold' in English indicates 'variety' or 'diversity'|the word 'manifold' which, in English, indicates 'variety' or 'diversity'!]]
