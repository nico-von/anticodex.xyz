Some [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|'to {verb}' forms]] in Italian express the past tense by placing [[The different conjugations for 'avere' in Italian|'avere', the Italian for 'have']] before their [[Forming Past Participles in Italian|past participle]], much as [[In English, the past participle can be used with 'have' to express an action that occurred in the past|'have' is used in English]]

For example:
To say 'I understood', take the past participle of [['capire' means 'to understand' in Italian|'capire']] by [[In Italian, to form the past participle of verbs ending in '-ire', simply replace '-ire' with '-ito' or '-ita'|replacing '-ire' with '-ito']] and adding [['Ho' is 'I have' in Italian|'ho', meaning 'I have']], before it: 'ho capito'.

If [[In Italian, when a direct object pronoun precedes a past tense formed with 'avere', the verb's past participle changes its ending to match the gender of the pronoun|it is preceded by a direct object pronoun, the verb's ending changes according to gender,]] otherwise, [[In Italian, the ending of verbs do not change according to gender|the rule that the ending of verbs do not change according to gender is kept]].

Using 'To have' does not apply for verbs of motion. [['to be' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have'|Such verbs use 'to be' instead]] and have [[In Italian, the ending of past participles used with 'To be' are changed according to the gender of the doer|their endings also changed according to gender]]. However, [[In choosing between 'to have' or 'to be' in making the past tense in Italian, the action must directly be about motion, the doer moves|the action must directly be about motion where the doer actually goes from a place to another]].

[[In Italian, 'essere' is used to express actions of the past with verbs where the person does the action to themselves|When talking about things done to oneself, 'avere' don't apply too, 'essere' is instead used]]
