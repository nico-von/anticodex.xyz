In italian, if a word that follows 'il' starts with a vowel, they are [[In Italian, some words that used in succession with certain words can be contracted together to form a single word|contracted]] into one word, the 'i' from 'il' is removed, and an apostrophe is added after the remaining 'l', it becoming 'l''

In other words, for [['Il' is Italian for 'the' (for singular masculine words)|singular, masculine words]] that begin with a vowel, the form 'l'{*vowel*-restofword}' must be used and not 'il {*vowel*-restofword}' i.e. 'l'amico'. 

The plural form for such words is treated differently as well: [[In Italian, 'Gli' is the article 'the' for plural words that are masculine and start with vowels|'gli']] and not [[The plural of 'il' is 'i' (not used on all plural words, used only on masculine plural words that would not be used with 'gli')|'i']] must be used.

With regards to the contraction, [[In Italian, if a vowel follows 'la', it contracts with the word it follows, and the 'a' in 'la' is replaced by an apostrophe|the same applies to 'la' with feminine words that begin with a vowel.]]
