English speakers can begin learning Italian by 'exposing' the Latin side of English, using it as an 'entry point' and a 'mental anchor'.

### Excerpt

Entry points:
1. [[Latin words in English can be identified by the way they look]]
2. [[Knowing the meaning of a part of a word can show clues to what the rest of the word means]]

Transformations:
1. [[Most English words ending in 'al' can be 'transformed' to Italian by simply adding an 'e' to the end]]
2. [[Some English words ending in '-ion' can be transformed to Italian simply by adding an '-e' to the end]]
3. [[To transform English nouns ending in '-tion' to Italian, simply replace '-tion' with '-zione']]
4. [[English '-ly' adjectives need only have '-ly' replaced with '-mente' to transform to Italian]]
5. [[Most English words ending in 'ible' and 'able' can be transformed to Italian by changing them to 'ibile' and 'abile]]
6. [[Simply removing the negating 'in' from some English words of a Latin origin reveals its Latin opposite, its root word]]
7. [[Most English verbs with noun forms ending in '-ation' can be transformed to their corresponding Italian 'to' verb form simply by replacing their '-ation' suffix with '-are']]
8. [[English words ending in '-ity' can be transformed to Italian by changing '-ity' to '-it√†']]
9. [[The Italian root of an Italian word from an English word transformation can be 'guessed' by attaching a vowel to the end and picking something that sounds best because it is something that you might have heard before]]
10. [[English words with a Latin origin that end with 'ent' or 'ant' can be transformed to Italian simply by adding an '-e' to the end]]
11. [[English words that can be transformed into Italian and have 'de' in them, which by etymology means 'of' or 'from', usually change to 'di' when transformed into Italian]]

[[In Italian, knowing one form of a word, such as its '-ing' adjective form, often allows one to identify its verb or past participle as well, and vice versa, provided that the rules for transforming between them are known by working backwards|Knowing one form of a word from any of these English to Italian transformations serves as an entry point to the many other forms that can be derived from that word!]]
