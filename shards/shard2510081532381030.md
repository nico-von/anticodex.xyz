Many Italian words carry multiple meanings. A simple example is 'La', it can mean [['La' is Italian for 'the'|'the']], [['la' is also 'her' in Italian|'her']], [['La' is the feminine form of 'it' in Italian|'it']] or even [['la' is 'there' in Italian|'there']]!

Meanings depend on [[Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them naturally through the context or the circumstances surrounding what was said|context]], [[Misplacing accents on an Italian word can change its meaning, 'lavoro' can mean 'he worked' instead of 'I work' if accented incorrectly|accent]] or [[In Italian, words must be clearly pronounced as they may lead to misunderstanding|pronunciation]], and tone of voice (For instance: [[You may request directly in Italian, letting context and tone of voice carry the intent, without needing to frame the request with 'can you' and without carrying the commanding tone such requests might have in English]]).
