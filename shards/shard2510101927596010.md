Because [['December' is related to the Italian word 'dieci']] and [['September' is related to the Italian word 'sette']], and [['September' used to be the 7th month]], and [['October' is related with the Italian word 'otto']] and [['October' used to be the 8th month of the year]] and [[Like 'September' related to the Italian word for 7, and 'October' related to the Italian word for 8, 'November' is related to the Italian word for 9|'November' is related to the Italian word 'nove']] and [['November' used to be the 9th month of the year]], it must follow that 'December' used to be the 10th month of the year at the time when [[One year used to have 10 months only]] because [['December' is related to the Italian word 'dieci']] meaning [['Dieci' is 10 in Italian|10]]
