In a [[A prisoner's dilemma occurs when opposing players, acting rationally out of self-interest and fear of betrayal, choose to act against each other, even though both parties would be better off if they cooperate|prisoner's dillema]], both players have access to a [[A 'dominant strategy' is when a player's best strategy never changes no matter what strategy the other players play|dominant strategy]], which leads to a guaranteed but lower [[A 'payoff' in game theory is simply the value a player will get after an interaction|'payoff']] than if the players cooperate for a bigger payoff. 

If one player uses the dominant strategy and the other do not cooperate, the former will still receive the relative best payoff(in that situation).

Whereas, if both players follow the other strategy which yields a bigger 'payoff' for both, through cooperation, and one players betray, the player who kept his word will instead receive a much worse 'payoff'.
