Italian Indirect Objects(to/for whom the verb is performed, or you can understand it as *who benefits from the action* or *in whose interest the action happens*) whereas [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|direct object pronouns recives the action directly]]
1. [['le' is 'to or for her' in Italian]]
2. [['gli' is 'to or for him' in Italian]]

They can be expressed [[Direct object pronouns in Italian usually come before the conjugated verb that points to them|before verbs like direct objects]], or [['a' can be used in Italian to say 'to whom'|expressed with 'a']]

[[In Italian, indirect('gli', 'le') and direct objects are combined together in one word by replacing the indirect object with 'glie' and attaching the direct object right after]]
