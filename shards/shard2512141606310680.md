Italian Indirect Objects(to/for/from whom the verb is performed, or you can understand it as *who benefits from the action* or *in whose interest the action happens*) whereas [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|direct object pronouns recives the action directly]]

Expressed [[Direct object pronouns in Italian usually come before the conjugated verb that points to them|before verbs like direct objects]] and placed before pronoun

1. [['mi' is the indirect object meaning 'to, from me' in Italian]]
2. [['le' is 'to, for, from her' in Italian]]
3. [['gli' is 'to, for, from him' in Italian]]
4. [['ci' is the indirect object pronoun 'to, for, from us' in Italian]]
5. [['ti' is the informal indirect object meaning 'to, from you' in Italian]]

Formal Variations of the above
1. [['Le' is the indirect object 'ti'(meaning 'to, from you', formal) in Italian]]

Placed after verb and [['a' can be used in Italian to say 'to whom'|expressed with 'a']]
2. [[In Italian, before a preposition, 'me' and 'te' are used instead of 'mi' and 'ti'|'a me', 'a te']]
3. [['voi' is the plural of 'tu' in Italian, and as such, it emphasises 'you'|'a voi']]
4. [['Noi' is for saying 'we' and adding emphasis to the doers referred to as 'we', often used with Italian verbs that end with '-iamo'|'a noi']]
5. [['lei' is 'she' in Italian|'a lei']]
6. [['lui' is 'he' in Italian|'a lui']]
7. [['Loro' is 'they' and for emphasis of 'they' in Italian|'a loro']]

Placed after verb even without 'a'
1. [['loro' can function as the indirect object 'to them' and is placed after the verb that points to it in Italian]]


[[In Italian, indirect('gli', 'le') and direct objects are combined together in one word by replacing the indirect object with 'glie' and attaching the direct object right after]]
