From various cases like:
1. [[Unlike English, 'it', as a direct object, usually comes before conjugated verbs that point to it in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want']]
2. [['you' or  'ti', as a direct object, can come before conjugated verbs that point to it in Italian]]

It can be observed that [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|'direct object']] pronouns usually come before the [[Verb conjugations to indicate the doer of the action in Italian|conjugated verb]] that [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|points to them]] in Italian. 

Indeed, this is [[Direct object pronouns in Italian MUST be in front of the conjugated verb that points its action to them, if there is no 'to {verb}' verb form that points to them and to which it can be attached|required if there is not a 'to {verb}' form to attach the direct object pronoun]].

If there also exists a 'to {verb}' verb form, the direct object pronoun may still be placed before the conjugated verb that gives the action. In this case [[If a 'to {verb}' verb form is present and another conjugated verb seems to point to the direct object pronoun too, that verb is instead understood to be pointing to the 'to {verb}' form with the direct object together|the direct object pronoun and the to {verb} is understood to receive the action from the conjugated verb together]].

It is also an [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together|option]] to put the [[If a verb is in its Italian 'to {verb}' form, direct object pronouns can be attached to the end of it|'direct object' pronoun at the end of the 'to {verb} form']], so long as [[In Italian, especially when there are two or more 'to {verb}' verb forms present, a direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the 'to {verb}' form it directly receives action from|the direct object directly receives action from that verb]].

If, however, [[If there is only an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end|only a 'to {verb}' verb form exists, the direct object pronoun can only be placed at the end of that verb.]] 

See [[The placement of direct object pronouns in Italian are subject to these rules|these placement rules]] for further clarification.
