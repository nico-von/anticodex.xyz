In Italian, the ending of [['essere' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have'|past participles used with 'To be']] are changed according to the gender(or number) of the doer[[In Italian, adjective endings usually change according to gender, but not always, as some adjectives end in '-e' and do not vary between masculine and feminine|(like adjectives)]]. 

This can happen to those [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English|used with 'to have']] too if [[In Italian, when a direct object pronoun precedes a past tense formed with 'avere', the verb's past participle changes its ending to match the gender of the pronoun|a direct object pronoun precedes it]]. If not, the rule that [[In Italian, the ending of verbs do not change according to gender|the ending of verbs do not change according to gender]] is kept.
