The outcome in a [[A 'dominant strategy' is when a player's best strategy never changes no matter what strategy the other players play|'dominant strategy']] is that the player always gets the relative best [[A 'payoff' in game theory is simply the value a player will get after an interaction|payoff]] of each situation and not the absolute best payoff(i.e. The highest reward)

To visually analyse payoffs, use a [[A tool for visually analysing a 'simultaneous game' is by utilising a 'payoff table' where all the 'payoffs' for each of the combination of choices are laid out|payoff table]]. 

(derived from [[A 'dominant strategy' is when a player's best strategy never changes no matter what strategy the other players play]] and [[In a 'prisoner's dilemma', both players have access to a dominant strategy, which leads to a guaranteed but lower 'payoff' than if the players cooperate for a bigger payoff. However, unlike 'the dominant strategy', this outcome is not guaranteed]]. See the latter as an example of relative best payoff(where a lower value payoff is the dominant strategy instead of a higher value payoff))
