1. [[A pre-requisite for a game to be fully solvable by backward reasoning is that there must not be uncertainty of any kind]]

What is meant by backward reasoning? [[That the first rule of strategy is to anticipate the future moves of other players and then work backwards from there|Anticipating the future moves of other players and then working backwards]]

When is backward reasoning usually used:
1. For [[About decision trees|Decision trees]]: [[The proper way of using a decision tree is not to follow the best looking branch, but to begin at an end and reason backward]]

When backward reasoning becomes too complex (e.g. [[The difficulty of scaling the 'decision tree' becomes harder as the number of turns and choices increase (like Chess)]]):
1. [[For games where purely backward reasoning becomes too complex, the player must rely on experience to evaluate the worth of current posituons without forcing a full solution, until such time as the game can be fully solved by backward reasoning]]
