[[If a verb is in its Italian 'to {verb}' form, direct object pronouns can be attached to the end of it|Placing a direct object to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}']] verb form is optional if another [[Verb conjugations to indicate the doer of the action in Italian|conjugated verb]] and the Italian 'to {verb}' exists together (meaning, if [[If there is only an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end|only a 'to {verb}' verb form exists, the direct object pronoun MUST be placed at the end of it]]).

In other words: The direct object pronoun can still be [[Direct object pronouns in Italian usually come before the conjugated verb that points to them|placed before the conjugated verb']] also pointing to it, if such a verb exists. In such a case, [[If a 'to {verb}' verb form is present and another conjugated verb seems to point to the direct object pronoun too, that verb is instead understood to be pointing to the 'to {verb}' form with the direct object together|the direct object pronoun is understood to receive the action with the verb in the 'to {verb}' form together]]. ^r-pfk

[[In an Italian phrase, it can be observed that when you have a 'to {verb}' form together with a direct object pronoun, despite the direct object pronoun's location, the pronoun is by default understood to receive its action from that 'to {verb}' form|It can be observed that when you have a 'to {verb}' form together with a direct object pronoun, the pronoun is by default understood to receive its action from that 'to {verb}' form]], but if there exists no 'to {verb}' verb form, [[When the form is non imperative, Direct object pronouns in Italian MUST be in front of the conjugated verb that points its action to them, if there is no 'to {verb}' verb form that points to them and to which it can be attached|following the rule, it must be placed in front of the conjugated verb.]]
