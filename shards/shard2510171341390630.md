1. [[For forming the past participle from verbs ending in '-are' in Italian, replace the ending with '-ato' or '-ata']]
2. [[In Italian, to form the past participle of verbs ending in '-ire', simply replace '-ire' with '-ito' or '-ita']]
3. [[In Italian, to get the past participle of verbs ending in '-ere', replace the '-ere' with '-uto' or '-uta']]

Do note that [[Sometimes, in Italian, forming the past participle involves a slight spelling change beyond the usual replacements, making them quite irregular]]
