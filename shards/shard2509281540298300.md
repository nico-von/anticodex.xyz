The Italian word [['Scappare' is 'to escape' in Italian|'scappare']] is also used colloquially for saying that it is late and it is time to leave

Examples:
1. It's late, let's split(let's escape): '[[An open 'e' sound, spelled 'è', in Italian means 'third person..is'|è]] [['Tardi' is the Italian word for 'late'|tardi]], [[To have regular Italian verbs have their 'to {verb}' verb forms conjugated to refer to the speaker and one or more other people considered together, replace the verb form ending with '-iamo'|scappiamo]]'
2. It's late, I'm going out of here: 'è tardi, [[Regular italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action|scappo]]' or 'io scappo'([['Io' can be used for emphasis by placing it in front of a sentence with 'o' already at the end of verbs signifying that the speaker is referring to himself|'io' used for emphasis]])
