In playing a game, put yourself in the [[When thinking strategically, the perspective of other players must always be considered(anticipated) - their information, their motivation(motives), what they think of you, whether they're irrational. As you are playing against people, not machines|perspective of the other players]]([[When making decisions, the aims of others must be considered. If conflicting, anticipate it, if coinciding, utilise cooperation|the aims of others must be taken into account]]), and be one step ahead of them by moving in anticipation to their next moves (see [[That the first rule of strategy is to anticipate the future moves of other players and then work backwards from there|the first rule of strategy]])
