And since [['Incredibile', from the transformation of 'Incredible', means 'Unbelievable' in Latin and Italian]], removing the [['In' is a prefix, like 'un', it negates the word it is attached to|negating 'in']] from 'incredibile' leaves the word 'credibile' which is Latin and Italian for 'believable'.
