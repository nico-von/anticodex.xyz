In Italian, the use of certain words is flexible, they can function as nouns, verbs or adjectives depending on [[Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them naturally through the context or the circumstances surrounding what was said|context]]

An example is [['Essere' is 'to be' in Italian|'essere']]. As a verb, it means 'to be', but by adding [['Il' is Italian for 'the'|'il']], [[The Italian word 'essere' can as well be a noun meaning 'being'|it becomes a noun meaning 'the being']]
