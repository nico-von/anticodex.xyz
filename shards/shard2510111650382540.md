In Italian, the use of certain words is flexible, they can function as nouns, verbs or adjectives depending on [[Words can be identical but we understand the meaning conveyed behind them naturally through the context or the circumstances surrounding what was said|context]]

An example is [['Essere' is 'to be' in Italian|'essere']]. As a verb, it means 'to be', but by adding [['Il' is Italian for 'the' (for singular masculine words)|'il']], [[The Italian word 'essere' can as well be a noun meaning 'being'|it becomes a noun meaning 'the being']]

Not only 'to {verb}' forms of verbs can show flexibility, [[The 'past participle' forms of certain Italian verbs are flexible that they can be used as nouns, past of verbs or adjectives|the past participle form of certain verbs may also serve as a noun, past tense or adjective too]]
