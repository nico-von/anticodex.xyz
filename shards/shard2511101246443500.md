About forming the plural of words in Italian

Do notice that [[The '-i' ending of Italian nouns usually indicate a plural form|an Italian noun ending in '-i' usually indicate a plural form]]:
1. [[Most Italian words that end in '-o' or '-e' get their plural form by transforming these endings to '-i']]
	1. Some need additional letters in addition to the change in ending: [[Italian nouns ending in '-go' form their plurals with '-ghi'|'-go' becomes '-ghi', not just '-gi']]
2. [[To get the plural of Italian nouns ending in '-zione' simply change the ending 'e' with 'i', to '-zioni']]

Plurals that do not end in '-i':
1. [[We can get the plural of most Italian words ending in '-a' by replacing '-a' with '-e']] 
2. [[Nouns ending in '-ità' retain their endings when transformed into their plural form, like 'le possibilità']]

Adjectives:
 1. [[Adjectives change their endings according to the gender and plurality of the nouns they describe]]
 
Note on applying these rules: [[Sometimes, transforming an Italian word to its plural form needs more than simply changing its ending]] 

Note on Gender and transforming words to their plural forms: [[It is usually the ending of Italian words and not their gender that is considered when having them transformed to their plural forms]]
