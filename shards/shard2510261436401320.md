Italian syntax patterns

1. Direct Object Pronouns
	- [[The placement of direct object pronouns in Italian are subject to these rules|Direct object pronoun placements]]

2. Verbs
	- [[In Italian, 'a' often links a verb of movement to a 'to {verb}' verb form, indicating that the motion is directed toward performing the second action]]
	- [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together]]
	- [[In Italian, especially when there are two or more 'to {verb}' verb forms present, a direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the 'to {verb}' form it directly receives action from]]
	- [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English]]
	- [['to be' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have']]
3. Adjectives
	- [[In Italian, adjective endings usually change according to gender, but not always, as some adjectives end in '-e' and do not vary between masculine and feminine]]
	- [[In Italian, it is common to have nouns before adjectives, for example saying 'it is a very known saying' in Italian, the syntax 'it is a saying very known' is used]]

4. Subjects
	- [[As 'io' and 'tu' are flexible and can be placed before or after the verb they emphasise, the same should go for other words of emphasis or doer of verbs]]

5. Possessives
	- [[In Italian, phrases using the form 'the {possessive}'(like 'la tua' or 'il mio') may stand alone without the noun they possess, for it is already implied by context]]
	- [[In Italian, to say that something possesses something else, the form 'the {possessive}' is generally used]]
	- [[In Italian, saying 'my' or 'your' or any other possessive sometimes does not follow 'the {possessive} {noun}' form, especially for some fixed expressions, in such cases, the possessive is placed after the noun without the article]]
6. Questions and question words
	- [[You may request directly in Italian, letting context and tone of voice carry the intent, without needing to frame the request with 'can you' and without carrying the commanding tone such requests might have in English]]
	- [[In italian, question words contracted with 'è' can stand by themselves to form general expressions (how it is, or he is, or she is; when it is, or he is, or she is and so on)]]
7. Misc
	- [['fare vedere', literally 'to make see' is the colloquial way of saying 'to show' in Italian]]
	- [['Di' is used with 'che cosa' to form the phrase 'di che cosa' which means 'of what thing' when asking questions]]
	- [[In asking 'What are you talking about' in Italian, 'Di ché cosa parli' is used, literally translated to 'Of what thing you speak']]
	- [[In Italian, the phrase 'ché cosa' or 'what thing' is often shortened to just 'cosa', (leaving just 'thing') causing 'cosa' to be another word for 'what']]
	- [['Non' means 'not' in Italian and often added before verbs to negate them]]
	- [[In Italian, when 'già' is used with 'avere', 'già' comes after it]]
	- [[When used to mean 'yet', 'Ancora' is placed in the same position as 'già']]
	- [[In Italian, 'già' is usually used with positive sentences while 'ancora'('yet') is usually used with negative sentences]]
