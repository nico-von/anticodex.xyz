Italian syntax patterns

1. Direct Object Pronouns
	- [[The placement of direct object pronouns in Italian are subject to these rules|Direct object pronoun placements]]

2. Verbs
	- [[In Italian, 'a' often links a verb of movement to a 'to {verb}' verb form, indicating that the motion is directed toward performing the second action]]
	- [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together]]
	- [[In Italian, especially when there are two or more 'to {verb}' verb forms present, a direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the 'to {verb}' form it directly receives action from]]
	- [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English]]
	- [['to be' is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion instead of 'to have']]
3. Adjectives
	- [[In Italian, adjective endings usually change according to gender, but not always, as some adjectives end in '-e' and do not vary between masculine and feminine]]
	- [[In Italian, it is common to have nouns before adjectives, for example saying 'it is a very known saying' in Italian, the syntax 'it is a saying very known' is used]]

4. Subjects
	- [[As 'io' and 'tu' are flexible and can be placed before or after the verb they emphasise, the same should go for other words of emphasis or doer of verbs]]

5. Possessives
	- [[In Italian, phrases using the form 'the {possessive}'(like 'la tua' or 'il mio') may stand alone without the noun they possess, for it is already implied by context]]
	- [[In Italian, to say that something possesses something else, the form 'the {possessive}' is generally used]]
	- [[In Italian, saying 'my' or 'your' or any other possessive sometimes does not follow 'the {possessive} {noun}' form, especially for some fixed expressions, in such cases, the possessive is placed after the noun without the article]]
6. Questions and question words
	- [[You may request directly in Italian, letting context and tone of voice carry the intent, without needing to frame the request with 'can you' and without carrying the commanding tone such requests might have in English]]
	- [[In italian, question words contracted with 'è' can stand by themselves to form general expressions (how it is, or he is, or she is; when it is, or he is, or she is and so on)]]
7. Prepositions
	- [[In Italian, prepositions such as 'for' are often unnecessary. For example, the English phrase 'he is waiting for me' is expressed simply as 'he awaits me']]
8. Articles
	- [[In Italian, the article for 'a' is dropped when saying that a person has a spouse]]
9. Misc
	- [['fare vedere', literally 'to make see' is the colloquial way of saying 'to show' in Italian]]
	- [['Di' is used with 'che cosa' to form the phrase 'di che cosa' which means 'of what thing' when asking questions]]
	- [[In asking 'What are you talking about' in Italian, 'Di ché cosa parli' is used, literally translated to 'Of what thing you speak']]
	- [[In Italian, the phrase 'ché cosa' or 'what thing' is often shortened to just 'cosa', (leaving just 'thing') causing 'cosa' to be another word for 'what']]
	- [['Non' means 'not' in Italian and often added before verbs to negate them]]
	- [[In Italian, when 'già' is used with 'avere', 'già' comes after it]]
	- [[When used to mean 'yet', 'Ancora' is placed in the same position as 'già']]
	- [[In Italian, 'già' is usually used with positive sentences while 'ancora'('yet') is usually used with negative sentences]]
	- [[In Italian, a definite article is added before titles like 'signor' and 'signora' when one refers to them in the third person]]
	- [[In Italian, when 'e' precedes an 'e sound' it becomes 'ed']]
	- When asking names: [['Qual è' or 'Quali sono' are used for asking 'what in particular' in Italian]], but [[In Italian, when one asks what someone's name is, the phrase 'Come si chiama(or another conjugation)... ' is commonly used]]
	- When expressing someone's age: [[In Italian, when expressing someone's age 'avere anni' rather than'essere anni' is used]]
	- When expressing the days of the month: [[In Italian, only the first of the month is regularly expressed with an ordinal number(primo), the rest uses regular numbers(due...trentuno)]]
	- When asking and telling time: 
		- Asking time [[When asking the time in Italian, both the singular and plural form of 'ora' can be used]] 
		- Telling time [['Alle {hours}' is used to tell the hour in Italian because when we say it is '{hours} o' clock', what is really being said is 'at {hour} hours', 'le' in 'alle' implies, through context, 'hours' which is feminine and plural]]
10. Syntax for comparing
	- [['l'altro', 'l'altra' is used when one wishes to refer to 'the other one' in Italian]]
	- [[In Italian, 'no' can be used instead of negating a repeated statement entirely to show that it does not hold for the other person]]
	- [['non è...né' is used to say 'is neither...nor' in Italian]]
	- [['più' is the Italian word for 'more']] while [['meno' is 'less' in Italian]]
	- [[In Italian, to express 'the most' or 'the least', a definite article is placed before 'più' or 'meno' followed by the adjective]]
	- [[In Italian, comparing two different things, 'di' is often used to express 'than']] while [[In Italian, when comparing properties of a thing, 'che' can is used to express 'than'|when comparing properties of a thing, 'che' is used instead]]
	- For likening things: [[When comparing qualities, 'come' is used to say 'as' or 'like' in Italian]]
11. Capitalisation
	- [[Unlike English, months are not capitalised in Italian]]
