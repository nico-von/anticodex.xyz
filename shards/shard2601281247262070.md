For games where purely [[Backward reasoning in game theory|backward reasoning]] becomes too complex(such as [[The difficulty of scaling the 'decision tree' becomes harder as the number of turns and choices increase (like Chess)|the problem with the scale of a decision tree for solving a game like Chess]]), the player must rely on experience to evaluate the worth of current posituons without forcing a full solution, until such time as the game can be fully solved by backward reasoning
