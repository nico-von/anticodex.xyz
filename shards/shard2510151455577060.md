'to be' or [['Essere' is 'to be' in Italian|'essere']] is used to create the past tense of Italian verbs of motion or movement[[In Italian, 'a' often links a verb of movement to a 'to {verb}' verb form, indicating that the motion is directed toward performing the second action|(the same verbs that can be used with another verb with 'a')]] instead of [[Some 'to {verb}' forms in Italian express the past tense by placing 'avere' before their past participle, much as 'have' is used in English|'to have']].

For example: Instead of saying '[['Ho' is 'I have' in Italian|ho(I have)]] venuto'â€¦'[['Io sono', or 'sono', is 'I am' in Italian|sono(I am)]] venuto' Is used! Instead of using 'ho andato', 'sono andato' is used!

[[In choosing between 'to have' or 'to be' in making the past tense in Italian, the action must directly be about motion, the doer moves]]

Also, despite the rule that [[In Italian, the ending of verbs do not change according to gender|the ending of verbs do not change according to gender]], this case is an exception: [[In Italian, the ending of past participles used with 'To be' are changed according to the gender of the doer|the ending of past participles used with 'To be' are changed according to the gender of the doer]]
