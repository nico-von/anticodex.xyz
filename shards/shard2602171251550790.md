The advantages of [[The 'Tit for tat' strategy is to cooperate first and then to copy what others have done to you in the previous period|'tit for tat']]:
1. [['tit for tat' never gets left behind, and can only be taken advantage of once during the first move of the strategy that is to cooperate]]
2. [['tit for tat', whenever possible, encourages cooperation without encouraging exploitation as it is neither too trusting nor too aggressive]]

And [[The disadvantages of 'tit for tat'-that it only results to losses and ties, that it is possible for an infinite loop of defections to happen, that a small chance of error can cause it to collapse entirely]]
