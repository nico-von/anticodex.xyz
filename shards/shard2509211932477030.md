Its placement is flexible.|'io']], there is also a word for saying 'you', describing the person the speaker is speaking to as the doer of the verb, and [[Italian words for adding emphasis to the doer of conjugated verbs|for emphasising that doer]] in Italian, and that is 'tu'

Also, [[Like io, 'tu' is flexible and can be placed before or after the verb that shows it refers to the person the speaker is addressing.]]
