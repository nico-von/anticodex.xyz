Like [['Io' can be used for emphasis in sentences with verbs that already end in 'o' (if it signifies that the speaker refers to himself). Its placement is flexible.|'io']], there is also a word for emphasising 'you' in Italian, and that is 'tu'

Also, [[Like io, 'tu' is flexible and can be placed before or after the verb that shows it refers to the person the speaker is addressing.]]
