While [[The 'c' in 'ci' or 'ce' in Italian is pronounced as 'ch'|'ce' gives the 'ch(e)' sound]], having an 's' immediately before it, like 'sce', gives the sound 'sh(e)' instead. This spelling can be found in words like [['Conoscere' is 'to know'(someone), or 'to meet'(for the first time) in Italian|'conoscere']].
