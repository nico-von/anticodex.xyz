Why use a decision tree? [[Formalisms (such as tables, or trees) provides a  way to understand and simplify similar situations but different in context by reducing them into one form]]

Limitations of decision trees: [[The difficulty of scaling the 'decision tree' becomes harder as the number of turns and choices increase (like Chess)]]

How to use a decision tree:
1. When playing turn based games: [[In using a decision tree when playing turn-based games, you must not only trace back from your desired future choices, but also anticipate the other players’ desired ends]]
2. General: [[The proper way of using a decision tree is not to follow the best looking branch, but to begin at an end and reason backward]]
