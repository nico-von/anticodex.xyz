When no noun has been previously mentioned and [['Ne' is used to hold the noun talked about in Italian|'ne']] is used, it refers to an implicit complement that is conventionally paired with the verb.

For example:'[['si' when followed by an object pronoun, becomes 'se' in Italian|se]] ne va' wherein 'ne' implicitly means 'from where he is'
