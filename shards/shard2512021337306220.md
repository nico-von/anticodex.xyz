In Italian, 'si' is used to refer to oneself(in the third person) when a subject does the action to themselves

For instance: [['si alza' is 'gets oneself up' in Italian|'si alza' is literally oneself gets up in English]]
### Excerpt
![[jensenLItalianoSecondoMetodo1962excerptindex#^7nxu-]]

Transforms to:
1. [['si' when followed by an object pronoun, becomes 'se' in Italian|when followed by a direct object pronoun, 'si' becomes 'se']]
2. [[Before a preposition, 'si' becomes 'sé' in Italian]]

In expressing the past tense: [[In Italian, 'essere' is used to express actions of the past with verbs where the person does the action to themselves|'essere' is used, because it is used to express actions of the past with verbs where the person does the action to themselves]] – [[An illustration of the 'si essere {verb}' form in Italian - 'si è tolto' is used to say 'he took it off(from himself)' while 'ha tolto' is used to say 'he took it off(not from himself)']]

It can as well be used to say 'one': [['si' can also be used to say 'one' like how 'si dice' means 'one says' in Italian]]
