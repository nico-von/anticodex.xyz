In Italian, each vowel must be pronounced.

However, for the vowel sound [[The vowel sound 'i' is sometimes pronounced less distinctly when it follows the vowel sound 'o' in Italian, producing the sound 'yo' rather than the distinct 'i-o', as in the pronunciation of 'giorno'|'i', it is pronounced less distinctly when it follows the vowel sound 'o', producing the sound 'yo' rather than the distinct 'i-o']]
