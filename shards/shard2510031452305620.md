The plural of the Italian possessive word [['mia' or 'mio' is the possessive 'my' in Italian|'mio']] is 'miei'. It is a bit irregular. The reason being that [['Mio' is made plural as 'miei' instead of 'mii', so as to separate the two consecutive 'i's that would otherwise be awkward|it is made plyral as 'miei' instead of 'mii', so as to separate the two consecutive 'i's that would otherwise be awkward]].

For example:
[[To say 'my friend' in Italian, 'il mio amico' can be used, literally, 'The my friend'|'Il mio amico']] becomes 'i miei amici'( where [[The plural of 'il' is 'i'|'il' becomes 'i']], 'mio' becomes 'miei', and the [[Most Italian words that end in '-o' or '-e' get their plural form by transforming these endings to '-i'|'o', in 'amico', becomes 'i']])
