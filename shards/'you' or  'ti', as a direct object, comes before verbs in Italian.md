Like [[Unlike 'English', 'it', as a direct object, comes before verbs in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want'|'it' or 'lo' in italian]], 'you' or 'ti'(as a [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|direct object]]) also comes before verbs in Italian, observed from the example, [['I love you' in Italian is 'ti voglio bene' which literally means 'You I want well'|'ti voglio bene']]

Perhaps, [[direct objects usually come before verbs in italian]]
