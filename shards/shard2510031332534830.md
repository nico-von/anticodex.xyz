In Italian, saying [['mia' or 'mio' is the possessive 'my' in Italian|'my'('mia')]] or [['tua' is the Italian feminine word for 'your'|'your'('tua'))]] or any other possessive sometimes does not follow [[In Italian, to say that something possesses something else, the form 'the {possessive}' is generally used|'the {possessive} {noun}' form]](examples are [[To say 'my friend' in Italian, 'il mio amico' can be used, literally, 'The my friend'|'il mio']] and 'la tua'), especially for some fixed expressions, in such cases, the possessive is placed after the noun without the article.

For example: to say 'to my house', '[[To stress 'my' in something like 'a casa' where 'my house' is implied, 'mia' can be added|a casa mia]]' is usually used, not 'a la mia casa'. Furthermore, as it is mentioned above that the article is removed when using this form, 'a la casa mia', is therefore incorrect.

Another example is [[The Italian expression 'mama mia' is usually used for expressing surprise or disbelief|'mama mia']], it is not formed as 'la mia mama'.

Another is [['Vita mia', literally, 'my life', is an endearment in Italian|the endearment 'Vita mia']]
