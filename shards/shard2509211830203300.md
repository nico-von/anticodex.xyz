In asking 'What are you talking about' in Italian, 'Di ché cosa parli' is used, literally translated to 'Of what thing you speak'

- [['di' is the Italian for 'of' or 'from'|'di' means 'of']]
- [[In Italian, the phrase 'ché cosa' or 'what thing' is often shortened to just 'cosa', (leaving just 'thing') causing 'cosa' to be another word for 'what'|'ché cosa' means 'what thing']]
- [['Parlare' is 'to speak' in Italian|'parlare' means to speak]], [[Some Italian verbs in their 'to {verb}' form can be transformed to indicate that the doer is the person the speaker is talking to by replacing the'to {verb}' form ending with '-i'|transformed the ending '-are' to '-i' to indicate you]], becomes 'parli'
