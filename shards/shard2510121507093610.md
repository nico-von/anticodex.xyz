In Italian, knowing one form of a word, such as its '-ing' adjective form, often allows one to identify its verb or past participle as well, and vice versa, provided that the rules for transforming between them are known by working backwards

The rules being:
- [[For forming the past participle from verbs ending in '-are' in Italian, replace the ending with '-ato' or '-ata']]
- [[In Italian, '-ing' adjectives derived from verbs ending in '-are' are usually formed by removing '-are' and adding '-ante']]
- [[In Italian, '-ing' adjectives derived from verbs ending in '-ire' are usually formed by removing '-ire' and adding '-ente']]


So for instance, one found the adjective 'differente' by [[English words with a Latin origin that end with 'ent' or 'ant' can be transformed to Italian simply by adding an '-e' to the end|transforming the English word]] 'different'. Knowing that '-ente' is an indication of the adjective form of [[Perhaps '-ire' is another 'to {verb}' form ending|'-ire' verbs]], one can guess that its verb form is [['Differire' is 'to differ' in Italian|'differire', and indeed, this means 'to differ']]. 'Differato' does not work because '-ato' only applies to [[Most English verbs with noun forms ending in '-ation' can be transformed to their corresponding Italian 'to' verb form simply by replacing their '-ation' suffix with '-are'|'-are' verbs]]
