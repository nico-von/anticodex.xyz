While [['a' is the locational, directional, 'to' in Italian|'a' means 'to' in Italian]], it also means 'At' in Italian since [['Alle {hours}' is used to tell the hour in Italian because when we say it is '{hours} o' clock', what is really being said is 'at {hour} hours', 'le' in 'alle' implies, through context, 'hours' which is feminine and plural|'Alle {hours}' means 'at the {hour} hours']] and [[In Italian, 'A' and 'le' when used together in succession, are contracted into one word 'Alle'|'alle' is just a contraction of 'a' and 'le']]
