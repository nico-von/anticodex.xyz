A prisoner's dilemma occurs when opposing players, acting rationally out of self-interest and fear of betrayal, choose to act against each other([[Players in a 'prisoner's dilemma' can either 'defect' or 'cooperate']]), even though [[In a 'prisoner's dillema' to 'defect' is the dominant strategy for both players, however, if both 'defect' they will do worse than they would if they both 'cooperate' instead|both parties would be better off if they cooperate]] (to get the best absolute [[A 'payoff' in game theory is simply the value a player will get after an interaction|payoff]]) 
In other words, [[In a 'prisoner's dilemma', both players have access to a dominant strategy, which leads to a guaranteed but lower 'payoff' than if the players cooperate for a bigger payoff. However, unlike 'the dominant strategy', this outcome is not guaranteed]]

[[In a prisoner's dillema, to 'discourage' defection players are subject to punishment, and to 'encourage' cooperation, players are subject to reward]]
