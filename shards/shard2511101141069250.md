In Italian, 'Gli' is the article 'the' for plural words that are masculine and start with vowels, otherwise, [[The plural of 'il' is 'i' (not used on all plural words, used only on masculine plural words that would not be used with 'gli')|'i' is used]].

In other words, it is used on the plural form of the same words that uses '[[In italian, if a word that follows 'il' starts with a vowel, they are contracted into one word, the 'i' from 'il' is removed, and an apostrophe is added after the remaining 'l'|l']]' instead of [['Il' is Italian for 'the' (for singular masculine words)|'il']].
