The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by [[Most English verbs with noun forms ending in '-ation' can be transformed to their corresponding Italian 'to' verb form simply by replacing their '-ation' suffix with '-are'|'-are']] or [[Like '-are', '-ere' indicates the 'to {verb}' form of verb too.|'-ere']] or [[Perhaps '-ire' is another 'to {verb}' form ending|'-ire']] at the verb's ending. 

[[In an Italian phrase, it can be observed that when you have a 'to {verb}' form together with a direct object pronoun, despite the direct object pronoun's location, the pronoun is by default understood to receive its action from that 'to {verb}' form]]
## On finding '-are' ending verbs from English
There is an easy way to 'find' '-are' verbs from English words: [[Most English verbs with noun forms ending in '-ation' can be transformed to their corresponding Italian 'to' verb form simply by replacing their '-ation' suffix with '-are']].

## Transformations
The Italan 'to {verb}' form can be transformed in several ways:

1. Direct object pronouns([[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|pronouns that receives the action of a 'to {verb}' verb form]]) like [['you' in Italian is 'ti'|'ti']], [['Mi' is 'myself' in Italian|'mi']], [[The plural of 'lo', or 'it', is 'li' in Italian. 'Li' means 'them'|'lo'and 'li']] (see [[A list of Italian direct object pronouns|this list for more Italian direct object pronouns]]) can be [[If a verb is in its Italian 'to {verb}' form, direct object pronouns can be attached to the end of it|added to the end of it]]. This is [[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together|optional if a 'to {verb}' form and another verb exists together]], but is a [[If there is only an Italian 'to {verb}' verb form, direct pronouns must be placed at the end|must if only the 'to {verb}' verb form exists]]. However, [[In Italian, especially when there are two or more 'to {verb}' verb forms present, a direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the 'to {verb}' form it directly receives action from|if there are more than one 'to {verb}' verb forms, the direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the verb it directly receives action from.]]
2. Pronouns that indicate the performance of the action of the '-are' verb are transformed differently:
	1. The speaker does the action: [[Regular italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action]] 
	2. The person the speaker is talking to does the action: [[Regular Italian verbs in their 'to {verb}' form can be transformed to indicate that the doer is the person the speaker is talking to by replacing the'to {verb}' form ending with '-i']]
	3. The speaker and a group of people considered together does the action(we): [[To have regular Italian verbs have their 'to {verb}' verb forms conjugated to refer to the speaker and one or more other people considered together, replace the verb form ending with '-iamo']]
3. For forming past participles
	1. [[For forming the past participle from verbs ending in '-are' in Italian, replace the ending with '-ato' or '-ata']]
