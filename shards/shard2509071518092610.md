However, [[In Italian, especially when there are two or more 'to {verb}' verb forms present, a direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the 'to {verb}' form it directly receives action from|if there are more than one 'to {verb}' verb forms, the direct object pronoun should only be attached to the end of the verb it directly receives action from.]]
