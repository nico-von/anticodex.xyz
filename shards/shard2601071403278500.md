'game theory' is the study of strategic decision making

Key lessons
1. [[In playing a game, put yourself in perspective of the other players, and be one step ahead of them by moving in anticipation to their next moves]]
2. [[That it is possible for a losing choice to be the best path to victory]]
3. [[A key player, other than his being good, also has the ability to draw attention away from his teammates and in doing so improves their offence]]
4. [[Sometimes it is best to wait for others to bear the risk then follow either immediately or only after success is proven(when reputation is at stake). This way you can capitalise without paying the cost of failure.]]
5. [[Know when to be immovable and when to yield]]
6. [[When chasing goals, one can ensure follow through by deliberately removing alternative actions, leaving the required action as the only path forward]]
7. [[A prisoners' dilemma can be engineered to force self-interested actors to support  some outcome that they would otherwise resist by making betrayal individually worse regardless of what others choose]]
8. [[Unpredictability by randomising plays should be built into your strategies to remain unreadable, but only to the extent that it does not prevent you from exploiting the predictability of your opponents]]
9. [[When someone is willing to take a bet against you, approach it with suspicion, their willingness itself is information. Use the information revealed by their actions to guide your strategies accordingly]]
