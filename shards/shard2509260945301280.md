Like [[Having an 's' immediately before 'ce', as in 'sce', in Italian, gives the sound 'sh' rather than 'ch'|'sce']], 'sci' also gives the sound 'sh(i)' in Italian. In other words, while [[The 'c' in 'ci' or 'ce' in Italian is pronounced as 'ch'|'ch(i)']] sound is given by 'ci', 'sh(i)' is given by 'sci'.
