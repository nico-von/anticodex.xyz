Verb conjugations to indicate the doer of the action in Italian

When the doer is the speaker:
1. [[Regular italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action]]

When the doer is the person the speaker is talking to:
1. [[Regular Italian verbs in their 'to {verb}' form can be transformed to indicate that the doer is the person the speaker is talking to by replacing the'to {verb}' form ending with '-i']]

When the doer is the speaker himself and one or more other people considered together(we):
1. [[The Italian ending '-iamo' indicates that the speaker refers to himself and one or more other people considered together, in other words, 'we']]
2. [[To have regular Italian verbs have their 'to {verb}' verb forms conjugated to refer to the speaker and one or more other people considered together, replace the verb form ending with '-iamo']]

About irregular verb conjugations:
1. [[Not every Italian 'to {verb}' form ending can be altered by a single letter alone to mark the subject who does the action. Some are irregular.]]
