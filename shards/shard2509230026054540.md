Verb conjugations to indicate the doer of the action in Italian

When the doer is the speaker:
1. [[Some italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action]]

When the doer is the person the speaker is talking to:
1. [[Some Italian verbs in their 'to {verb}' form can be transformed to indicate that the doer is the person the speaker is talking to by replacing the'to {verb}' form ending with '-i']]

About irregular verb conjugations:
1. [[Not every Italian 'to {verb}' form ending can be altered by a single letter alone to mark the subject who does the action. Some are irregular.]]
