[['ci' is 'there'(abstract) in Italian|'ci']] can be used to refer to a previously understood context(as in 'under those circumstances') in Italian

For example: 
'non *(not)* ci *(where the context was that the child thinks he has to break his leg to be given a camera)* si *(one breaks)* la gamba così(in that way)' meaning: **'one does not break their leg(forcibly) like that'**
