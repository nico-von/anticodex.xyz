Not every Italian [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|'to {verb}' ending]] can be altered by a single letter alone(like replacing it with [[Regular italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action|'-o']] or [[Regular Italian verbs in their 'to {verb}' form can be transformed to indicate that the doer is the person the speaker is talking to by replacing the'to {verb}' form ending with '-i'|'-i']]) to mark the subject who does the action. 

Some are irregular.

An example is [['Vuoi' is 'you want' in Italian|'vuoi' being 'you want']] while [[In Italian, 'Voglio' means 'I want'|'voglio' being 'I want']], such transformations [[Conjugating the root of the Italian words 'vuoi' and 'voglio' is quite irregular as the endings are not simply replaced|doesn't merely come from changing the ending of their roots.]]

Another example is [['puoi' is 'you can' in Italian|'puoi' being 'you can']] while [['I can' or 'I am able' is 'posso' in Italian|'posso' being 'I can']]. 

Another is [['fare' is the Italian word for 'to do' or 'to make'|'fare']], [['Tu fai' is 'you make' or 'you do' in Italian|'Tu fai' being 'you make']]
