Not every Italian [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|'to {verb}' ending]] can be altered by a single letter alone(like replacing it with [[Regular italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action|'-o']] or [[Regular Italian verbs in their 'to {verb}' form can be transformed to indicate that the doer is the person the speaker is talking to by replacing the'to {verb}' form ending with '-i'|'-i']]) to mark the subject who does the action. 

Others are irregular [[Irregular verbs are prevalent in most commonly used verbs, especially in Italian|and are prevalent on most commonly used verbs!]]

An example is [['Vuoi' is 'you want' in Italian|'vuoi' being 'you want']] and [['Vogliamo' is 'we want' in Italian|'vogliamo' being 'we want']] while [[In Italian, 'Voglio' means 'I want'|'voglio' being 'I want']], such transformations [[Conjugating 'volere' is quite irregular as the endings are not simply replaced|doesn't merely come from changing the ending of their roots.]]

Another example is [['puoi' is 'you can' in Italian|'puoi' being 'you can']] and [['possiamo' is the Italian for 'we can'|'possiamo' being 'we can']] while [['I can' or 'I am able' is 'posso' in Italian|'posso' being 'I can']]. 

Other examples:
1. [['fare' is the Italian word for 'to do' or 'to make'|'fare']]: [['Tu fai' is 'you make' or 'you do' in Italian|'Tu fai' being 'you make']]
2. [['dare' is 'to give' in Italian|'dare']]: [['dai' is 'you give' in Italian|'dai' being 'you give']]
3. [[The Italian verb 'essere' is irregular|'essere']]: [['Sei' is 'you are' in Italian|'Sei' being 'you are']]

Despite the irregularity, they still seem to possess the expected endings: [[Regular italian 'to {verb}' forms can be changed to an ending in '-o' to show that the speaker is the one doing the action|'-o' for when the speaker refers to himself]], [[While the ending '-i' sound of Italian nouns usually indicate the noun's plural form, the ending '-i' sound of Italian verbs indicate that the speaker refers to the person he is speaking to|'-i' for when the speaker refers to the person he is speaking to]] and [[The Italian ending '-iamo' indicates that the speaker refers to himself and one or more other people considered together, in other words, 'we'|'-iamo' for when the speaker refers to himself and one or more other people. considered together]].
