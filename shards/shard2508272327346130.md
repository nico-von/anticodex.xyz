If a verb is in its [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are', '-ere' or '-ire' at the verb's ending|Italian 'to {verb}']], pronouns(like [['you' or  'ti', as a direct object, can come before conjugated verbs that point to it in Italian|'ti']] and [['It' in Italian is 'lo'|'lo']]) can be([[Placing a direct object pronoun to the end of a verb in its Italian 'to {verb}' form is optional if another conjugated verb and the Italian 'to {verb}' form exists together|optionally]]) attached to the end of it([[In attaching a pronoun to the end of a verb with an Italian 'to {verb}' form, the 'e' is removed, replaced with the pronoun|by removing the ending '-e' and having it replaced with the pronoun']].)

This is true for [[What directly receives the action of a verb is called a 'direct object'|'direct object' pronouns]], refer to [[A list of Italian direct object pronouns|this for a list of such pronouns]].
