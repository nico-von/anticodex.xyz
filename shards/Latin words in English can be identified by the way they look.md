Latin words in English can be identified 'by the way they look'. 

### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianexcerptindex#^squza]]

Such as:
1. [[Most English words ending in 'al' are from Latin]]
2. [[Most English words ending in 'able' and 'ible' are from Latin]]
3. [[Sometimes, English words prepended with negating 'in' are of Latin origin]]

Knowing these patterns is useful for [[Knowing the meaning of a part of a word can show clues to what the rest of the word means|helping shed light to the meaning of the word without the need for looking it up]].
