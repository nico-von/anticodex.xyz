'invitare' means 'to invite' in Italian

(Derived from the example in conjugating to {verb} forms to reflect 'we': [[To have regular Italian verbs have their 'to {verb}' verb forms conjugated to refer to the speaker and one or more other people considered together, replace the verb form ending with '-iamo'#^bu42i|'we invite you'… 'Ti invitiamo']])

And [['invitati' is 'guests' in Italian]]
