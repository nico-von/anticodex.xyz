In Italian, [['Già' is 'Already' in Italian|'già']] is usually used with positive sentences while [['Ancora' is 'yet' in Italian|'ancora'('yet')]] is usually used with negative sentences(often indicated by the presence of the word [['Non' means 'not' in Italian and often added before verbs to negate them|'non']]). 

Therefore, [[As the Italian word 'ancora', when it means 'yet', is usually used with negative sentences, would therefore often be used on ones with the word 'non', 'già' on ones without.]]
