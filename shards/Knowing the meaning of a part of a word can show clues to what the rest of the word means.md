Knowing the meaning of parts of a word can shed light to its origin, how the word came to be
### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianexcerptindex#^28m3e]]

For instance, [[Some English words with the prefix 'con-' use it to mean 'with', similar to the Italian 'con', as in the word 'conform'|the prefix 'con-' in the word 'conform' literally means 'with', the entire word literally meaning 'with form', shows a clue as to the meaning of the word conform without looking it up]]. 

[['Confermare' literally means 'with firm'|Another is the word 'confirm' or 'confermare' in Italian]]

Another is [['Complicate' literally means 'with folding' in Italian|complicate]], the prefix [[Like 'con-', 'com-' also means 'with'|'com']], also meaning 'with', literally means 'with folding'. The meaning of the word from this information can at first be quite confusing, however, when connected with [[Simple-mindedness is 'einfalt', in German, which literally means 'One fold'|the German word for 'simple-minded': 'einfalt', literally meaning 'one fold']], the significance of fold is suddenly brought to light, as if [['Fold' signifies layers of complexity]].

Another is [[In languages of Latin origin, at least in Italian and in English, the Latin root of 'monster' was also the root of 'dimostrare' and 'demonstrate'|the Latin root of 'monster']] which signifies [[A 'monster' was once considered an omen, sign, message from the Gods|as showing a sign]], like how in Italian, the verb, 'to show', is [['To show' is 'mostrare' in Italian|'mostrare']], and the verb, 'to demonstrate', is [['Dimostrare' is the Italian of 'to demonstrate'|'dimostrare']].
