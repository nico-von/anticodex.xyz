### Excerpt
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianexcerptindex#^28m3e]]

For instance, [[Some English words with the prefix 'con-' use it to mean 'with', similar to the Italian 'con', as in the word 'conform'|the prefix 'con-' in the word 'conform' literally means 'with', the entire word literally meaning 'with form', shows a clue as to the meaning of the word conform without looking it up]]. 

Another is [['Complicate' literally means 'with folding' in Italian|complicate]], the prefix [[Like 'con-', 'com-' also means 'with'|'com']], also meaning 'with', literally means 'with folding'. The meaning of the word from this information can at first be quite confusing, however, when connected with [[Simple-mindedness is 'einfalt', in German, which literally means 'One fold'|the German word for 'simple-minded': 'einfalt', literally meaning 'one fold']], the significance of fold is suddenly brought to light.
