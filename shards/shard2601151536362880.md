A 'simultaneous interaction' of decisions simply means that decisions of players are made at the same time, and each player is aware of the existence of other players 

[[Neither player has information of their opponent's current move in games where interaction is simultaneous, instead they must think about what the other is currently thinking]]

An example of such game is [[A prisoner's dilemma occurs when opposing players, acting rationally out of self-interest and fear of betrayal, choose to act against each other, even though both parties would be better off if they cooperate|the 'prisoner's dillema']]

In contrast, [[A 'sequential interaction' of decisions means that the decisions of players occur in turns, like Chess]]
