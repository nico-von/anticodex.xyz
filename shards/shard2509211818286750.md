Like [['Quando' is 'When' in Italian|'Quando']] [[Italians commonly use the word 'cosa' for asking 'what' because when they ask 'what', they often mean to ask 'what thing' and 'cosa' is the short form of the Italian phrase for 'what thing'|'cosa']] can as well be combined with 'è ché', like [[The Italian word 'Quando' can sometimes be used with 'è ché' to indicate 'When is it that...'|'Quando è ché']] and [[In Italian, some words that precede a word beginning with a vowel can be contracted with it to form a single word|contracted]] to 'cosè ché', like, [[The Italian phrase 'Quando è ché' can be contracted to just 'Quandèché'|'Quandèché']]
