'[[In Italian, 'A' and 'le' when used together in succession, are contracted into one word 'Alle'|Alle]] hours' is 'At {hours} o'clock' in Italian

An example is 'alle [['Sette' is 7 in Italian|sette]]' or '7 o'clock'

[['Alle {hours}' is used to tell the hour in Italian because when we say it is '{hours} o' clock', what is really being said is 'at {hour} hours', 'le' in 'alle' implies, through context, 'hours' which is feminine and plural]]
