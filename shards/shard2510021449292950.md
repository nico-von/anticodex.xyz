Italian nouns ending in '-o' are usually masculine

This can be observed from endings where the corresponding masculine nouns of female nouns end up ending in '-o', i.e. [[The Italian for 'friend' is 'amico' for male, and 'amica' for female|'amica' to 'amico']], [['mia' or 'mio' is the possessive 'my' in Italian|'mia' to 'mio']], [['tua' is the Italian feminine word for 'your'|'tua']] to [['tuo' is the Italian masculine word for 'your'|'tuo']]

Some are feminine, however, such as [[In Italian, 'Auto' despite ending in 'o' is feminine, simply because it is a shortcut of 'automobile' which is feminine|shortcuts of feminine words that up ending in 'o', like 'auto' from 'automobile']]
