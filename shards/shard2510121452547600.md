In Italian, adjectives derived from verbs ending in [[Perhaps '-ire' is another 'to {verb}' form ending|'-ire']] are usually formed by removing '-ire' and adding '-ente'

An example: [['Differire' is 'to differ' in Italian|'differire'('to differ')]] becomes [[English words with a Latin origin that end with 'ent' or 'ant' can be transformed to Italian simply by adding an '-e' to the end|'differente'(meaning 'different', also can be from a transformation of the same English word by adding an 'e')]]
