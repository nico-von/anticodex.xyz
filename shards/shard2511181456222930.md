Italian express the hundreds as it does the tens([[In Italian, numbers in the ones place are simply attached(sometimes with some alteration) to those in the tens place, like English, as in 'forty-five' becomes 'quarantacinque'|by setting the ones after the tens]]), by setting the tens after the hundred

(Derived from example: [['trecentosessantacinque' is 365 in Italian]], where [['trecento' is 300 in Italian|'trecento' is the word for 300]])
