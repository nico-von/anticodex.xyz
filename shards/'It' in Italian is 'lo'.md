'It' in Italian is 'lo'

### Excerpts
![[eleftheriouIntroductionItalianexcerptindex#^vghu1]]

And, [[Unlike 'English', 'it' comes before verbs like in Italian, instead of saying 'I want it', in Italian, it becomes 'It, I want']]

However, [[Negation comes before 'it' in Italian, instead of saying 'I do not want it', it becomes, 'not it I want' or 'non lo voglio']]
