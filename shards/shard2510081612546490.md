[[In Italian, when 'è' comes after 'come', they are contracted to 'comè'|'Comè']], like [[The Italian word 'Dove' can be contracted with 'è', becoming 'dovè', to say 'Where is it(or he, or she)' all by itself|'dovè']], can [[In italian, question words contracted with 'è' can stand by themselves to form general expressions (how it is, or he is, or she is; when it is, or he is, or she is and so on)|stand by itself]] to say 'How is it (or he, or she)'

An example: 'I don't know how he is' becomes 'Non [['So' is 'I know' in Italian|so]] com'è'. 'He' in this example is clearly ommitted.
