In Italian, [[Italian Indirect Objects|indirect]]([['gli' is 'to, for, from him' in Italian|'gli']], [['le' is 'to, for, from her' in Italian|'le']]) and [[A list of Italian direct object pronouns|direct objects]] are combined together in one word by replacing the indirect object with 'glie' and attaching the direct object right after

Example: 'gli + le' = 'gliele', 'le + le' = 'gliele'


Like [[In Italian, when combining two direct object pronouns together, 'mi' becomes 'me', 'ti' becomes 'te, and 'ci' becomes 'ce'|how 'mi' becomes 'me', 'ti' - > 'te', but adding an 'e' as a bridge instead of changing the ending 'i' to 'e']]
