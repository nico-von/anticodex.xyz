It is usually the ending of Italian words and not their gender([[About feminine Italian words|feminine]] or [[Masculine is the default gender in Italian for words whose gender can not otherwise be determined|masculine]]) that is considered when having them transformed to their plural forms

Ending specific transformations:
1. [[We can get the plural of most Italian words ending in '-a' by replacing '-a' with '-e'|Most words with 'a' endings can be made plural by replacing it with 'e']]
2. [[Most Italian words that end in '-o' or '-e' get their plural form by transforming these endings to '-i']]
