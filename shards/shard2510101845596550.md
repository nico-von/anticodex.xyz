Like [['Attività' is 'Activity' in Italian|'activity' becoming 'attività']] in Italian, the 'ct' in 'October'([['October' used to be the 8th month of the year|that used to be the 8th month]]) becomes 'tt' [['October' is related with the Italian word 'otto'|when comparing it with 'otto']], the [['Otto' is 8 in Italian|Italian word for 8]]

[[Perhaps the 'ct' and 'tt' difference when comparing English and Italian words is an example of some kind of assimilation]]
