To transform an [[The 'to {verb}' verb form in Italian is indicated by '-are' or '-ere' at the Italian verb's ending|'-are' verb form]] to something where the speaker describes that he is doing the verb, i.e. ('I {verb} or I am {verb}ing'), like [[In Italian, 'Voglio' means 'I want'|'voglio' or 'I want']], the '-are' from the '-are' verb form must first be removed, and then replaced with the same [[The 'o' in 'devo' indicates that it refers to the speaker|'o']] as that in verbs like 'voglio' or 'devo' to indicate that the speaker is talking about himself (the 'I'))

For example: 

[['Lavorare' is 'to work' in Italian|'Lavorare' or 'to work']] becomes [['Lavoro' means 'I work' or 'I am working'|'lavoro' or 'I work']]

However, [[Not every Italian 'to {verb}' form ending can be altered by a single letter alone to mark the subject who does the action.]]
