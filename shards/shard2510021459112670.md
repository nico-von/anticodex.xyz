### Excerpt

This is similar to when [[In italian, if a word that follows 'il' starts with a vowel, they are contracted into one word, the 'i' from 'il' is removed, and an apostrophe is added after the remaining 'l'|'il' follows a vowel they are contracted into one word, the 'i' from 'il' is removed, and an apostrophe is added after the remaining 'l' ]]

Another similar concept is when [[In Italian, when 'è' comes after 'come', they are contracted to 'comè'|'è' follows 'come', they are contracted into one word 'comè']]
